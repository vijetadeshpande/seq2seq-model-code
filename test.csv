"The fifth season of HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" made history at the Emmy Awards  on Sunday, when it became the first sci-fi or fantasy show ever to win Best Drama and its 12 total awards broke the record for the most won by any show in a single year.  
 
Yet some have griped  that, even if ""Game of Thrones"" is a great show, this wasn't its best season . Indeed, that this may even have been its worst season . Season 5 was almost certainly its most controversial season, especially because of the (SPOILER ALERT) the marital rape  of Sansa Stark in Episode 6 and the sacrificial burning of Shireen Baratheon  in Episode 9, neither of which has yet happened in George R.R. Martin's novels. 
 
Some of the show's creatives, including the director of Episode 6 , have addressed these controversies in the past. But evidently, ""Game of Thrones"" creators Dan Benioff and D.B. Weiss still feel the issue is unresolved. In a post-Emmy interview with Entertainment Weekly , Benioff said that they ""never set out to offend anyone"" by staging those brutal moments. 
 
""To try to offend anyone would be juvenile, but to be afraid to offend people would be cowardly,"" Benioff explained. ""There were people saying they were never going to watch again. We’re just trying to tell the story the best we can."" 
 
It was certainly good enough for Emmy voters! And for quite a few viewers at home  as well.

Meteorologists are split over whether Hurricane Joaquin will slam the East Coast.  Joaquin is now pushing through the Atlantic Ocean just southeast of Florida, and some models have it hitting the mid-Atlantic region by Sunday.  
 
The storm bulked up to hurricane status early this morning and could possibly grow up to a Category Three storm with winds topping 110 miles-per-hour.  Forecasters are predicting heavy rain all the way from North Carolina to Maine in the coming days as they keep an eye on the storm.

The Moors are sixth in the table, with two wins and two draws. 
 
Yet they face a Clitheroe side at the Brewery Field today one place and a point above them. 
 
Ainsley said: “Clitheroe are coming here full of confidence after their good start to the season. 
 
“They have already won away from home once this season at Droylsden, which is no mean feat. We have to make sure we win and not drop out of the promotion pack.” 
 
Spenny will be without Glen Taylor (toe), Danny Frost (foot) and Michael Hogganson (appendicitis). 
 
Priestley Keithley has joined on non-contract terms from Middlesbrough and, though frustrated by injuries in his forward ranks, Ainsley is delighted by the form of strikers Liam Henderson and Nathan Fisher. 
 
He added: “We have not had much continuity because of the injuries. 
 
“Frosty has only played 18 minutes of the first game and Glen injured his toe at home but their (Henderson and Fisher’s) workrate and commitment have been excellent and they will probably start against Clitheroe.”","Spennymoor Town must be wary of 'full of confidence' Clitheroe, says Jason Ainsley"
"Facebook may finally be getting a button that lets you quickly express something beyond a ""like."" 

Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Tuesday that people have been asking for a ""dislike"" button on the social media site for years. 

Speaking at an event at Facebook's Menlo Park, California, headquarters that was streamed live online, Zuckerberg acknowledged that ""like"" isn't always appropriate for some posts — about a tragic news event, for example — when people might want to express empathy. 

Zuckerberg said the company, however, has veered away from making a ""dislike"" button, which could be used to vote down other people's posts. He said the new button is ready to be tested soon and could be rolled out broadly depending on how it does.

Speaking to Corriere della Sera, Darmian said: ""The important thing for me is that even though I'm a foreigner, I settled in straight away at Manchester United, thanks also to my team-mates and the staff who made me feel part of the group.

ROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- The latest on the funeral for Adam Ward, the WDBJ-TV cameraman who was fatally shot by a former co-worker on live TV Wednesday in Moneta, Virginia (all times local): 
 
Noon: 
 
The pastor at the church attended by Adam Ward's family told mourners that just as in life, the WDBJ-TV cameraman has left an impact on others through his death. 
 
The Rev. Rob Lough told more than 500 people at Ward's funeral at First Baptist Church in Roanoke about Ward's compassion and laughter, his passion and wit. 
 
Lough related several jokes that the Virginia Tech graduate would tell at the expense of archrival University of Virginia. 
 
Lough told several stories, including the time Ward's principal at Salem High School, who uses a wheelchair, challenged him to a race. 
 
Another story was about when Ward disrupted the press box at Virginia Tech's football stadium by cheering after the Hokies scored a touchdown. 
 
Lough says Ward loved people -- ""and the people loved Adam Ward."" 
 
11:30 a.m. 
 
With mourners packing the modern, massive First Baptist Church, the funeral of slain WDBJ-TV cameraman Adam Ward is underway in Roanoke. 
 
Five pews at the front left of the church were reserved for the family. WDBJ employees filled eight pews on the church's front right side. 
 
A wreath of Virginia Tech orange and deep red flowers was draped over Ward's closed casket. He graduated from the school in 2011. 
 
Behind the altar, an 80-member choir in white robes and a 10-member string section waited to perform as an organist played hymns before the funeral began. 
 
Three stories up in the balcony, a two-man production crew adjusted sound and light boards. 
 
5:20 a.m. 
 
A funeral is set for a 27-year-old television cameraman who was fatally shot along with a station reporter. 
 
Adam Ward's funeral will be held Tuesday at First Baptist Church in Roanoke, Virginia, a few miles from where he worked. 
 
Ward and WDBJ morning reporter Alison Parker were gunned down by a former co-worker on live television during an interview Aug. 26. 
 
On Monday, Ward was remembered at a reception at his high school for his infectious personality, youthful enthusiasm and rabid love for alma mater Virginia Tech. 
 
In his open casket at the Salem High School auditorium, Ward's body was dressed in a Hokies cap and white shirt. Well over 1,000 mourners attended the reception.",The Latest: Pastor: Slain cameraman made an impact on others
"The leader of Iran's legislature has definite views on his country's nuclear deal with world powers. 

Ali Larijani says the agreement is good enough. He adds that United States' reading of that deal, particularly when it comes to sanctions, is not good at all. And he's hoping that the agreement brings change in his country — though not as much as many Iranians would want. 

The lawmaker expressed those views to NPR during a visit to New York. While he is not one of the clerics who hold ultimate power in Iran, he is a consummate insider. He was a top national security official before his election to parliament. His brother leads the judiciary, and the family has important business interests. He is considered a true conservative in his country, and his views open a window into Iran's complex governing elite. 

Larijani supported the negotiations that led to the agreement, which places limits on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of global economic sanctions. He called the final terms ""acceptable."" 

""I believe that we can use this deal as a step we can take to move forward. And at the same time, it is not flawless,"" he said. 

Indeed, Larijani expects lawmakers in Iran's sometimes contentious assembly to complain. 

Critics In The Iranian Legislature  

The assembly speaker met with NPR at a New York hotel. He was dressed in a suit and no tie, in the style of the Islamic Republic. He's in his 50s, old enough to recall all the years from the 1979 Islamic revolution to this historic moment. 

He has held positions in the revolutionary government since its early years. He now leads a legislature that, like Larijani himself, is considered conservative. He says many lawmakers are skeptical of the deal. 

He pointed to provisions he considered unequal. The U.S., for example, can make sanctions snap back into place if it thinks Iran breaks the deal. 

""But that is not true for us. We cannot return to the situation that we were in the past,"" he said. 

Larijani sees many of Iran's concessions — like removing the core of a reactor – as permanent. 

His concerns are the opposite of those voiced by American critics. U.S. skeptics worry Iran is temporarily setting back its nuclear program to get out of sanctions forever; Iranians argue they're setting back their program for sanctions relief that may be temporary. 

Larijani's anxiety was evident in our conversation. ""If something ... happens in the U.S. Congress, or if there are new types of sanctions on us, then they should not expect us to go — to implement. Or if the Americans don't stay true to their obligations on their part, they shouldn't expect us to do it."" 

His remark pointed to one of the sticky points in this agreement. 

It's designed to lift nuclear sanctions against Iran. 

The U.S. says it offers Iran no assurances about sanctions imposed for non-nuclear issues. 

U.S. Says Sanctions Remain An Option  

The United States has insisted it will keep up the pressure against Iran on other issues. 

In an NPR interview in August, President Obama underlined this point:""We'll still have our sanctions in place with respect to non-nuclear activities like sponsorship of terrorism or violation of human rights."" 

That matches what Secretary of State John Kerry told NPR shortly after negotiating the deal. He said the U.S. was, ""absolutely"" free to punish Iran for acts like supporting the militant group Hezbollah. 

So how would Iran respond if the U.S. imposes new sanctions, or reimposes old sanctions, for issues other than nuclear issues? 

Larijani suggested that could lead to trouble. 

""There are different points mentioned in the text that need to be read carefully,"" he said. ""The text said that no country will go after new sanctions."" 

If Iran views the other side as violating the deal, ""we will respond accordingly."" 

The two sides may agree on what the nuclear deal says on paper. But arguments loom over what it really means in practice. 

""I think there are some people who want to wreck the deal, so they are trying to find new ways to make holes or to perforate the deal, but we are not going to do this,"" Larijani said. But, he added, ""if anybody wrecks the deal in any way, then we will know how to respond to it."" 

Will Reforms Follow?  

Larijani's answer to one question was particularly revealing, both in what he said and what he did not say. 

This was the question: Is there a specific economic, political, or social reform that is likely to become reality now? After all, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has indicated that he would like reforms inside Iran to follow a nuclear deal. 

""I think he meant, mostly he meant, economic reforms,"" Larijani answered. ""So, I see very much eye-to-eye with him in this matter,"" Larijani said. ""I think we can make it possible for the economy to thrive."" 

He dismissed questions about political or social reforms. He said nothing of easing Iran's constraints on personal freedom, or the media, or the Internet. He argued instead that Iranian society is more free than that of its neighbors. 

Asked if Iran might now free political candidates who've been under house arrest since a disputed election in 2009, Larijani said only that it was up to the justice system. 

Asked if Iran might free several imprisoned Americans, such as the journalist Jason Rezaian , Larijani suggested that the United States should trade Iranian prisoners for them. 

A Way To Move Forward  

Larijani cautioned that the nuclear deal alone might not transform Iran's relations with the West. ""Iran and the U.S. have this past history that is very dark,"" he said. 

Larijani recited the Iranian view of that history. He didn't mention moments on Americans' minds, like the 1979 hostage crisis, or Iran's calls to eliminate Israel, or Iran's past secret nuclear activities. He talked instead of 1953, when the U.S. supported a coup in Iran. In the 1980's the U.S. supported Iran's mortal enemy, Saddam Hussein of Iraq. 

Working through this history, the soft-spoken Iranian gradually became more heated. 

""I'm not saying that we should live in the past, but we should not try to find dramatic solutions,"" he said, ""and if we see that there is a change in the U.S. attitude toward us, then we can do something with each other."" 

As translated by his official interpreter, Larijani went on to say: 

""You know, these days we are supposed to paving the ground for the ratification and the implementation of the deal. We have to prepare the public opinion for this, but everyday it seems that your secretary of defense [Ash Carter] wakes up in the morning, opens the window, he shouts something at Iran and says that the military option is still on the table. 

So what does this mean? If you really want to do — to have war, then just go with it. Why are you just talking about it all the time? Why is it that you just talk about it? I mean, does — does it solve anything? Is it of any use?"" 

A Farsi speaker employed by NPR heard Larijani's wording slightly differently—he did not literally say ""go with it""—but added that the interpreter properly captured Larijani's meaning and tone. 

A provocative question had led to Larijani's outburst: would he like to invite U.S. lawmakers, many of whom disapprove of the nuclear deal, to visit Iran? 

Larijani concluded his long answer by saying, in effect, that this is not possible yet. 

He described the nuclear agreement as a test for the United States — just as the United States has posed the agreement as a test for Iran.","Iran Parliament Chief: Nuclear Deal Is 'Acceptable,' U.S. Interpretation Is Not"

"Former St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Joaquin Andujar died Tuesday in the Dominican Republic at age 62 after an extended battle with diabetes. 
 
Andujar was to be honored in his hometown of San Pedro de Macoris on Tuesday and buried Wednesday. 

The right-hander finished his major league career with a 127-118 record and a 3.58 ERA with the Cardinals, Houston Astros and Oakland Athletics. He was named to the All-Star team four times in 13 seasons and helped the Cardinals win the 1982 World Series, posting a 2-0 record against the Milwaukee Brewers in the Fall Classic, including a victory in Game 7. 

In 1984 and 1985, Andujar won 20 and 21 games and finished fourth in the National League Cy Young Award voting both years. He was considered one of baseball's top pitchers in the 1980s. 

""Joaquin struggled for years with diabetes and in recent days had deteriorated a lot,"" former major league pitcher and fellow Dominican Mario Soto said, according to ESPN. ""He was hospitalized several times but always came out unscathed. However, he surrendered to the disease that consumed him completely."" 

The Cardinals paid tribute to Andujar on Twitter, saying ""He was 'One Tough Dominican' & a member of our Cardinals family. We loved him & we will miss him. RIP Joaquin Andujar"" 

Andujar also played for 14 years in the Dominican winter league. 

""We extend our deepest condolences to the relatives of Mr. Andujar, a fierce pitcher who always gave the maximum on the mound,"" said Leonardo Matos Berrido, president of the Dominican winter baseball league.",Former pitcher Andujar dies at 62
"I had my annual doctor's visit today. All is well and my OB/GYN was thrilled to hear that I'm on WW and attending meetings. She said something that really struck me. She said, ""We are all a work in progress, my dear."" So true. 
So that got me to thinking about September and the progress I want to see when the month comes to a close. In the past, that would have been easy. I would have picked some arbitrary ""lost this amount of weight"" number and set that as my goal. This time I around, I've learned. I need to find success and joy in more than the scale. I need to find it in new habits and my commitment to a way of life. That said, here are my commitments for September: 

1)  Stop stressing myself out on weigh-in days! I go to a Tuesday evening meeting after work. For weeks, I've struggled with trying to figure out how much I can eat and drink throughout the day so that it doesn't throw my weigh-in off. Do any of you struggle with this? This month, I'm going to focus on consistent days, not numbers on the scale. No more Tuesday stress. 

2) Enjoy the transition to fall by getting outside to exercise! I love fall. The sights, the smells, the activities, the return to comfy sweaters and other comfy clothes. I'm going to take in every moment and try to incorporate at least one outdoor workout into my weekly routine. Last night, my daughter and I walked three miles. It was her first day back to school and I spent the entire 45 minutes talking with her about her day, her friends, her life. It was priceless and I am definitely going to do it again soon! 

3) Finding joy in NSVs! I'm a big scale watcher. I weigh myself twice a day and I've always used that number as my ""go to"" measure of success. This month, I'm going to focus on other things. Did I track all week (and I mean EVERY bite)? Do these pants fit better? Can I walk further/stay on the elliptical longer without feeling so tired? The scale will drop if I keep working hard. It won't be on my timeline maybe, but that's okay as long as I'm seeing progress. 

So, here's to September and making it a great time to shape up and slim down!",September Shape Up!

Who wants one-third of the Bakken oil produced each day going through their state? It is one of the most dangerous and hazardous oils in the world. False and inflated promises of tax income for our citizens will be proven. 

Our state will realize the labor force to install the pipeline came from out-of-state and the wages went out the border. We will remain with damaged land, a great liability, the anticipation of polluted water, and oh, yes, maybe we should have addressed the issue of eminent domain.

"UK-based discount chain Poundworld posted record annual sales today. 



The company said that it plans to continue its rapid expansion by opening 60 new stores a year from next year. 

The UK’s second-largest single price discount retailer, behind Poundland, said sales jumped 22% to £422.3m in the 12 months to the end of March in a period when it opened 38 stores, with like-for-like sales up 5.6%. 

The group added that operating profits also hit a record, more than doubling by 130% to £14.6m. 

US buyout group TPG took a majority stake in the business for £150m in May, in a deal which saw founder and chief executive Chris Edwards become a multimillionaire. 

Mr Edwards founded the business from a market stall in Wakefield in 1974. 

Poundworld said as a result of new funding from TPG it will accelerate its store expansion programme to in excess of 60 stores a year from 2016 onwards. 

Mr Edwards said: “We have seen a record financial year and one of landmark progress for the company.” 

He added that he expected “the year ahead to be one of development and consolidation.” 

Mr Edwards said the firm would invest in a new 500,000 square foot warehouse next to its Normanton head office in West Yorkshire, and replace its IT ordering systems. 

He said these changes “will provide a strong platform for rapid growth over the next three years.” 

The group added that its multi-price discount chain Bargain Buy, which trades from more than 50 outlets, saw like-for-like sales lift by 8% over the year.

"Press Release From: Aerospace Industries Association 

Although the end of summer indicates the beginning of classes for students across the country, it also signals the kickoff of the world's largest annual student rocketry contest. Registration for the Team America Rocketry Challenge (TARC) is now open for teams of 7-12th grade students through December 4. 

TARC is the U.S. aerospace and defense industry’s flagship program designed to encourage students to pursue study and careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). Structured to emulate the aerospace industry's design, fabrication and testing process, TARC requires teams to build and fly a model rocket that meets challenging design requirements and precise targets for altitude and flight duration. 

Each year, TARC's rules and scoring parameters change to challenge the students' ingenuity and encourage a fresh approach to rocket design. This year's rules require teams to build and launch a rocket carrying two raw eggs to 850 feet and return them to Earth unbroken within a flight duration of 44 to 46 seconds. A new requirement this year calls for the eggs to be placed perpendicularly to each other, thus complicating how teams protect the eggs in flight. Damaged eggs disqualify the flight. 

The 100 top-scoring teams from across the country will be invited to compete in the National Finals in Washington D.C. next spring. The winners will then represent America in the International Rocketry Challenge, competing against student teams from the United Kingdom and France at the Farnborough International Airshow near London next July. 

The Aerospace Industries Association and the National Association of Rocketry (NAR) sponsor the annual competition in partnership with NASA, the Department of Defense, the American Association of Physics Teachers and a number of AIA member companies.

"New Product Gives Marketers Access to Real Keywords, Conversions and Results Along With 13 Months of Historical Data 

SAN FRANCISCO, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 09/17/15 -- Jumpshot, a marketing analytics company that uses distinctive data sources to paint a complete picture of the online customer journey, today announced the launch of Jumpshot Elite, giving marketers insight into what their customers are doing the 99% of the time they're not on your site. For years, marketers have been unable to see what organic and paid search terms users were entering, much less tie those searches to purchases. Jumpshot not only injects that user search visibility back into the market, but also makes it possible to tie those keywords to conversions -- for any web site. 

""Ever since search engines encrypted search results, marketers have been in the dark about keywords, impacting not only the insight into their own search investments, but also their ability to unearth high converting keywords for their competitors,"" said Deren Baker, CEO of Jumpshot. ""Our platform eliminates the hacks, assumptions, and guesswork that marketers are doing now and provides real data: actual searches tied to actual conversions conducted by real people with nothing inferred."" 

Unlike other keyword research tools that receive data through the Adwords API or send bots to cobble together various data inputs and implied metrics, Jumpshot leverages its panel of over 115 million global consumers to analyze real search activity. As a result, Jumpshot is able to provide companies with actionable data to improve the ROI of their search marketing campaigns, SEO tactics and content marketing initiatives. 

Available today, Jumpshot Elite provides 13 months of backward-looking data as well as: 

Access to real queries used by searchers 

Paid and organic results for any website 

Visibility into organic keywords, eliminating the ""not provided"" outcome in web analytics 

Real user queries, clicks and transactions instead of machine-generated clicks with inferred results 

Ability to tie keywords to real transactions on any website 

Variable attribution models and lookback windows 

Launched in January, 2015, Jumpshot grew out of the ambitions of a group of smart marketers and data scientists who were frustrated about the limitations of the data they had access to, and excited about the opportunity to provide new insights into online behavior. 

The company uses distinctive data sources to paint a complete picture of the online world for businesses, from where customers spend time online to what they do there and how they get from place to place. By tracking the online customer journey down to each click, Jumpshot reveals how and why customers arrive at purchase decisions. The company tracks more data in more detail than other services, tracking 160 billion monthly clicks generated by its extensive data panel. 

About Jumpshot 

Jumpshot is a marketing analytics platform that reveals the entire customer journey -- from the key sources of traffic to a site, to browsing and buying behavior on any domain. With a panel of 115 million users, Jumpshot provides marketers with the insight to understand what their customers are doing the 99% of the time they're not on their own site -- a scope of information never before attainable. Jumpshot was founded in 2015 and is headquartered in San Francisco.

The major function of agrochemicals is to address the problem that hinders the growth of crops. It is a widely used term that includes fertilizers and pesticides. Agrochemicals help to increase the productivity of the crops by supplying needed nutrients and providing protection from various diseases, without harming the environment. Thus, the focus of industry players is not only to develop and launch agrochemicals, but also to train its end-users about the proper use of these chemicals. The tightening environmental regulations in developed regions such as North America and Europe are making it difficult for the manufacturers to sell their conventional products in these regions. Hence, they are bound to develop new products that fulfill environmental norms. It has, thus, become important for them to find a right balance between the product performance and content of their product.

Early buyers will receive 10% customization on reports. According to the estimates, Asia-Pacific leads the market for Agrochemicals with 41.3% share in demand at global level in 2012, followed by Latin America (17.0%), North America (15.4%), Europe (7.8%), and Rest of the World (18.5%). Looking at fertilizers type, Nitrogenous fertilizers occupied 68.4% and Organophosphates occupied 73.0% share in demand in their respective agrochemicals type.

The growth of the Agrochemicals Market has been studied through in-depth analysis of major factors that are driving the market such as growing population and increase in demand for food with opportunities in the development of environment friendly and rising consumer awareness for agrochemicals. However, the increasing environmental concerns and availability of other environment friendly alternatives are proving to be the major restraining factors for the market.

SAN ANGELO, TX

I was impressed with the acceleration and cutting D-Mac showed (albeit limited number of runs) in this last game. On the heels of this performance, how do you feel the RB competition shakes out?

David: Am I alone in thinking that it really and truly doesn’t matter? No matter who the Cowboys send out for the first snap on Sept. 13, he isn’t going to get 392 carries like DeMarco Murray did last fall. I really do believe this will be a committee. Maybe McFadden will lead the team in carries, maybe it’ll be Randle – maybe there’ll even be a new running back in the mix. But multiple ball carriers are going to have a chance to make an impact, one way or another.

Bryan: I have gone on record in saying that I believe that Darren McFadden CLINT BOYTE

LEXINGTON, KY

With no single receiver really stepping up this offseason to grab the No. 5 spot, could you see the Cowboys bringing in someone like Ryan Broyles in a case of maybe he just was never really given a chance?

David: I can’t say for sure whether the Cowboys have looked at Broyles – sorry, Sooner fans. That said, I won’t be remotely surprised if the Cowboys’ No. 5 receiver is not currently with this team. None of the guys on the roster have done a great job of stepping up and claiming the job, in my opinion. Jason Garrett and Stephen Jones love to talk about how they’re always looking to improve the roster. If there’s a guy out there who’s a step up from the current options, it’s a safe bet they’ll take a look.

Bryan: I am going down that road that the 5th receiver on this club is on another team. As far as it being Ryan Broyles – I don’t think that’s the case. What needs to happen is for this front office located a guy much like they had in Laurent Robinson. To make that happen, this front office might have to flip a draft pick, which I would be willing to do. ©2014 Dallas Cowboys. All rights reserved.

"Prevalence of Autism in North Carolina Exceeds the National Rate 

RALEIGH, NC, September 07, 2015 /24-7PressRelease/ -- College football inspires passions and pageantry like few other sporting events across the nation. Many people avidly follow their favorite football teams during the fall. The law firm of Hardison & Cochran, Attorneys at Law, wants to channel some of that energy to raise awareness of autism, a common developmental disability. 

Ben Cochran, managing partner of the Raleigh law firm, announced today the firm is joining forces with the Autism Society of North Carolina and Carolina Football to increase understanding of autism, a brain disorder with widely varying effects, and the needs of those affected by it. 

""We're excited to be partners with the Autism Society of North Carolina and Carolina Athletics again this football season to raise autism awareness in the Tar Heel State,"" Cochran said. ""Our mission is to help North Carolina families. Improving public understanding of autism certainly fits with that."" 

Hardison & Cochran and the Autism Society of North Carolina will serve as co-sponsors of the Tar Heels' first home game against the North Carolina A&T Aggies, set for 6 p.m. September 12 at Kenan Stadium in Chapel Hill. Autism Society staff members will be available on game day to answer people's questions about autism, which affects tens of thousands of people across North Carolina. 

In addition to the game sponsorship, Hardison & Cochran will sponsor commercials highlighting autism awareness during Carolina football radio broadcasts as well as on Head Coach Larry Fedora's television show. The firm also will purchase advertising in the program to be sold to fans at this year's home games. 

Autism is a developmental disability that affects a person's behavior skills as well as their ability to communicate and interact socially. 

According to the Autism Society, more than 60,000 North Carolina residents cope with the Autism Spectrum Disorder, which refers to a group of developmental disabilities affecting a person's capacity to grasp what they see, hear and sense, such as classic autism, Asperger's syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). 

North Carolina's incidence of autism is higher than the national rate, with 1 in 58 people born with the disorder compared to 1 of 68 children across the country, according to the Autism Society of North Carolina.

"In her Wexner retrospective, filmmaker Penelope Spheeris excavates her iconic and primal past  
It was Black Flag squatting in a dilapidated church.  Darby Crash muttering his classic “puzzled panther” musings. A coked-up Ozzy cooking an egg, or the infamous scene  of W.A.S.P. guitarist Chris Holmes chugging straight  vodka from his swimming pool as his mother looks on. 
 
Director Penelope Spheeris’ iconic Decline of Western Civilization series of documentaries were fly-on-the-wall portraits of the Los Angeles’ subcultures in full bloom—and in mid-decay. 
 
But for the longest time, save the occasional midnight screening or happened upon bootleg VHS copy, the Decline films and their raw portrayal of the burgeoning punk and metal scenes were never given their proper due in the age of the DVD. That’s all about to change with the Shout! Factory re-issues of the entire trilogy, filled with hours and hours of extras giving Spheeris a closure to her work. There were no copyright issues or finagling with bands wanting a chunk of change in their twilight years—it was simply a matter of Spheeris feeling instinctively unnerved at watching her life pass before her. It was footage she couldn’t handle watching. 
 
Speaking with a very confident and still invigorated Spheeris, it was apparent she knows her arena as a filmmaker. Despite being responsible for hits such as Wayne’s World , Black Sheep , and, to a lesser degree, The Little Rascals , it’s the Decline films that have become her calling card and life’s work. The only way to convey her enthusiasm about her upcoming visit to the Wexner Center to introduce the landmark first film is through our brief, but enlightening conversation. 
 
Growing up around a lot of cultural shifts, during The Decline of Western Civilization , you were in your mid-30s. Were you a part of that scene? What drew you to document that particular punk scene in Los Angeles? I had been going to those punk clubs. I was definitely a part of the scene and I knew most of the people in the movie before I decided to make a movie. I was older, but I think I was still working out my childhood issues and I saw their childhood issues and decided to make a film about it. 
 
Speaking of childhoods, I truly feel that the film shaped the way I appreciate music and what I appreciate, so that’s a really good answer.  Good. That’s good to hear. 
 
I guess the same question is relevant for The Decline of Western Civilization II: The Metal Years , which was made seven years later. Were you equally attracted to the metal scene in Los Angeles, or were you just playing the role of documentarian?  I’ll have to be honest with you. I was going to those clubs too. I wouldn’t have made that movie if I wasn’t a part of that scene as well. I’m ashamed to admit that I was a part of that scene. 
 
You shouldn’t be ashamed. I think in a lot of ways, those first two films were blueprints for their respective scenes, or genres. Especially The Metal Years , where putting a band like London up against clips of Ozzy and Kiss posed an interesting juxtaposition. I haven’t talked about this much, because with these re-releases I didn’t want to watch any of it. I was forced to watch this again. I couldn’t handle it. But when I look at them I see so many aspects of attitude and style and trends that are still prevalent to everyday life. When I filmed them, they were unique. 
 
Just the jargon even, the language… the word “headbanging” for instance. I love the part when the audience members are explaining to you just exactly what “headbanging” entailed.  Yeah. I think that was eventually a cemented part of our culture with the “Bohemian Rhapsody” scene in Wayne’s World . At the same time, it kind of killed the authenticity of something that was once an honest part of a culture. 
 
I didn’t want to even touch Wayne’s World and just focus on the Decline films, but I do think that for you, Wayne’s World may have been this zenith of punk and metal—like your ironic raspberry towards what was then considered “alternative.”  I think I got to do Wayne’s World because of The Metal Years . There wasn’t anyone else who was a director in Hollywood who knew anything about that music either way. Plus I knew Lorne Michaels. It changed my life. I kind of wished I hadn’t made it only because I could have made the films I wanted to make but then I would’ve been broke. But yeah, it pokes fun at a lot from my past.” 
 
For me, seeing the original Decline was a sort of cultural gauntlet. I was 13 and watching from a dubbed VHS copy. Did you have the foresight when you made it that it could be that type of landmark for that scene and that music?  Well there was a guy in Singapore the other day who asked me how the kids in the third Decline could have seen the first Decline since it wasn’t available, but you just explained it. What happened was, even though it wasn’t available it became an underground contraband and established it that way. 
 
Is there any kind of subculture or counter-culture that you see currently that is vital? Something that you would like to expose or document? What is IV?  The answer to that and I’m sure you’ll understand, is that today everyone has a camera. I hate to say the subject matter because of that, because anyone can go and make that movie now. But somewhere deep down in the bottom of the hard drive of one of those movies is the beginning of Decline IV . I’m looking forward to doing it and people are always for it. 
 
Spheeris will introduce the original Decline of Western Civilization on Friday, October 23 at the Wexner Center at 7 p.m. Parts II and III will screen on Saturday, October 25 at 2 p.m.",Punk’s Not Passed
"IMAGE: This is a female of Sphex flammeus, a new species named after its strikingly red body. view more Credit: Thorleif Dörfel, Museum für Naturkunde After being mostly neglected for more than a hundred years, a group of digger wasps from Australia has been given a major overhaul in terms of species descriptions and identification methods. This approach has led to an almost 50% rise in the number of recognized species of these wasps on the continent. The study was published in the open access journal ZooKeys.They call them with names like ""Great Golden Digger"" or ""Great Black Wasp"" in the US and there is a good reason behind it. However, some of these digger wasp species do not impress solely with their looks, but also with their wide range of distribution. Members of the wasp genus Sphex can be found in almost every area of the world. Two researchers from the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, Thorleif Dörfel and Dr. Michael Ohl, have now reexamined the species diversity of Sphex in Australia.More than a century has passed since the last revision of this group in the Down Under. Using pinned, dried individuals from museum collections all over the world, Dörfel and Ohl inspected over 900 specimens and recorded the morphological characters that they deemed most useful for species differentiation.A very different lifestyle sets apart some species in the genus Sphex from the common idea that most people evoke on hearing the term ""wasp"". Not being eusocial, each female constructs a separate, subterranean nest for their offspring, which is then filled with grasshoppers (or other insects, depending on the wasp species) that have been paralyzed by a sting as a food supply for the larvae. These wasps avoid contact with humans and generally do not show aggressive behavior toward us.With 23 species known from Australia before this study, now the number has risen to 34. Most of these newly discovered species come from large quantities of material which had not been identified up to species level before. Dörfel and Ohl's work also provides an up-to-date identification key, both in a regular and in an interactive form, that covers all known Australian species of the genus. Specifically designed to be easily usable and containing many helpful images, it can be utilized by anyone with even minimal prior training.""Many insect groups are in urgent need of a revision or reclassification"", explained Thorleif Dörfel. ""Our understanding of ecosystems depends on the ability to identify the species that are a part of them. The focus of this study was merely a single continent, but we are currently preparing a follow-up project in which we plan to examine representatives of this wasp genus from every major geographic area. Hopefully, this is going to help everybody who works on these animals, whether now or in another one hundred years.""###Original source:Dörfel TH, Ohl M (2015) A revision of the Australian digger wasps in the genus Sphex (Hymenoptera, Sphecidae).

"Family Day Trip to a Kid-Friendly Long Island Winery Sep 22 2015 By Stephanie Ogozalek Apples and pumpkins aren't the only things ripe for the tasting on Long Island this fall harvest season. The bucolic North Fork is home to many family-friendly wineries that make for great day trips. Adults can indulge in a variety of fine vintages, while children picnic and frolic in the wide-open fields. The gorgeous Sparkling Pointe Winery in Southold, Long Island is a particularly sweet destination for NYC families. Though it's less than two hours by car from Midtown Manhattan, it feels worlds away thanks to its grand opulence and wide selection of sparkling wines. And because it's just a short drive away from many other family attractions, including a working lighthouse and pick-your-own apples, you can make a fun day of it with the kids. The lovely patio overlooking the vineyard at Sparkling Pointe. Start your day with a bit of bubbly at Southold's Sparkling Pointe, the only winery in New York State that solely produces sparkling wines. Order by the glass or sample them all with a grand tasting flight, which is what I usually do (just make sure you have a designated driver). What makes this spot unique is its tasting house (not a room), which is sleek and trendy with Brazilian art adorning the walls and soothing piped-in music. Thanks to the large space and relaxed vibe, it's more of a cafe experience where you can linger, making it perfect for wine tasting with children in tow. Plop down on the low-slung couches around the fireplace or sit on the outdoor patio overlooking the grape vines in warm weather. A dedicated server pours each variety at your table, and you can purchase complementary snacks like locally made cheeses, charcuterie and chocolates that the kids are sure to gobble up. While Sparkling Pointe welcomes kids of all ages, it's smart to bring a small toy or book, or bust out your smartphone for fidgety tots. However, my 10-year-old is always content to sit quietly and savor the snacks. Opened in 2010, this winery is a popular stop on the Long Island wine trail, but if you visit soon after its 11am daily opening on a Saturday or Sunday, or any time on a weekday, you may get the place to yourself. RELATED: More Family-Friendly North Fork Wineries Climb to the top of the Horton Point Lighthouse for stunning views. After you've had your fill, the Horton Point Lighthouse is just a quick five-minute drive away. This working, 19th-century lighthouse has no age or height restrictions, so everyone in your family can try to climb to the top of the 58-foot tower, where you'll be rewarded with panoramic views of the town and the Long Island Sound. There's also a cute nautical museum with various artifacts. The lighthouse is open seasonally on weekends through Columbus Day, but the surrounding eight-acre park is accessible every day year-round. The apples are always within reach at Woodside Orchards. No North Fork autumn getaway is complete without a stop at a local farm. There are several apple-picking places in the area, but my family's favorite is Woodside Orchards in Aquebogue, about a 20-minute drive back toward the city. Woodside's semi-dwarf apple trees are only 10-feet high, so the fruit is low enough for even little kids to pluck right off the branches. Plus the adorable country store sells delicious cider, doughnuts, pies and other baked goods. RELATED: Best Pick-Your-Own Apple Farms on Long Island The ironically named Modern Snack Bar is steeped in nostalgia. Wrap up your day with dinner at Modern Snack Bar, an old-school diner opened way back in 1950. Only a few doors up the road from Woodside, it's easy to find, just look for the awesome retro neon sign. The decor is kitschy and the service friendly at this family-run eatery, which serves up comfort food staples like burgers, fries and shakes along with more sophisticated fare such as seafood entrees and roast Long Island duck. We always finish with slices of homemade pie. All photos courtesy of the respective establishments.

"DO YOU ever find that just when you're about to arrive at the end of your tether, something or someone pops up and manages to reassure you that people are good. 
 
Whether you are debating or merely observing a debate about religion or politics, these two topics have to be the most draining. 
 
It was a bit like that this week reading the social media spew following the Liberal Party spill. 
 
Going by the letters to the editor and the online commentary, the issue of Syrian refugees is a topic that like no other manages to nullify empathy and decency. Reading some of the bile that people write can be truly depressing.

Victor Cruz has not appeared in an NFL game in almost a year, but a timetable has finally been set for the New York Giants wide receiver to return to action.
While Cruz has only been spotted running on the side at practice over the past several days, Giants coach Tom Coughlin revealed on Friday that he expects Cruz to make his 2015 debut against the Buffalo Bills in Week 4.
“That’s what we’ve been told,” Coughlin said according to Paul Schwartz of the New York Post.
Cruz has been dealing with a strained calf in addition to rehabbing from a ruptured patellar tendon in his right knee that he suffered last season. He was expected to be ready for the start of the 2015 season before the setback, and Coughlin provided very few updates on Cruz’s status prior to Friday.
“He’s improving and we’re hoping,” Coughlin said. “He’s running. He’ll be running all weekend, and we’re hoping that there’s nothing but straight ahead positives in all his activities, and we’ll see next wee",Victor Cruz expected to play in Week 4
"NEW YORK — Time and time again Serena Williams escaped during this Grand Slam season on her quest to sweep all four majors. But finally, on Friday, she hit a roadblock that caused her not just to trip, but to fall.

That hurdle came in the most unlikely of forms in Roberta Vinci, a 32-year-old world No. 43 who was making her debut appearance in a Grand Slam semifinal.

It also came in the form of unthinkable pressure loaded onto the shoulders of the 33-year-old world No. 1, who was trying to sweep all four majors in a calendar year for the first time since 1988, when Steffi Graf did so.

""I don't think we can understand the scale of what she felt,"" said Leif Shiras, a TV commentator for British broadcaster Sky Sports and former player in an interview. ""It's tough to play against history. You have to feel like her loss is a symptom of that pressure.""

Williams swatted away any suggestion that her Friday demise — after 26 Grand Slam match wins this year and 33 dating to Wimbledon last season — was due to expectation of the moment.

""I told you guys I don't feel pressure,"" a tired Williams told reporters in a news conference. ""I never felt pressure. … I never felt that pressure to win here. I said that from the beginning.""

From the beginning of 2015, however, Williams' drive for the Grand Slam has been a fragile, bumpy one. At the French Open she worked through five three-setters, the most of any major in her career; at Wimbledon she trailed Heather Watson by two breaks in the third set in the third round; a week ago Bethanie Mattek-Sands had her on the ropes in a night match.

Each time, a Serena 'W;' but not today.

""Today was not a good day,"" her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, told a small group of reporters, saying Williams woke up feeling off.

""Players are humans,"" he continued. ""How many times did it happen this year where she felt like this and she still found her way through? She didn't find her way today.""

Even Vinci, undone by Williams four times (all in straight sets) coming in, could see the most feared opponent in tennis looking tentative, double faulting, yelling at herself to find a way.

""(In) my mind, I say, 'Think about this, she's nervous,'"" a smiling Vinci said. ""So I tried to keep fighting for every single point.""

""It was apparent to all of us who have watched her for 20 years that she was nervous today,"" Chris Evert said plainly on ESPN.

It was a different kind of match than most of her three-setters at the majors, however. Seven times she had come back from dropping the first set. But only once in a three-set match did she drop the second – as she did Friday – and then right herself.

In the third set against Vinci, Williams appeared lost and at times confounded, however. She barked at herself at one moment, all of Arthur Ashe yelling shouts of encouragement. The next, she was quieting herself — palm towards the ground — trying to stay calm.

""I was just trying to win points at that point and win the match,"" she explained.

One shouldn't underestimate the emotional impact of the Slam, Shiras said.

""The toll of this journey she was on was too much for her today,"" Shiras said. ""She was trying to dig deep and the way to generate energy for her is to get that passion out. But I think that can tire her; there is an element of fatigue that plays into this story. She was at a breaking point; she was boiling. And Vinci was drawing that out of her. It was amazing drama.""

The pressure finally got to Serena Williams and killed her Grand Slam dream

Drama with a twist: On this day, the 21-time major champion, chasing history in front of a home crowd, with more power on her racket than anyone in the game was on the losing end. A defeat with a capital 'D.'

""Every loss is difficult,"" Mouratoglou said. ""I think she lost her way mentally. Tactically she didn't know what to do. When you make the wrong choices, you lose the points you're supposed to win and then you make more and more wrong choices. She lost her way on the path tactically.""

A road that started in Melbourne ends in New York — and not in the way Williams imagined.

"Just in time for the holiday shopping seasons, Apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. iPhone's price sees steep increaseAll the Apple announcements Just in time for the holiday shopping season, Apple has announced a series of hardware upgrades for the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. With the iPhone, the company added a feature called 3D Touch, which lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen. The Apple TV got its first big upgrade in more than three years with a more powerful chip and a redesigned remote control. Apple's family of iPads also gained a bigger sibling with the iPad Pro, a tablet with a 12.9-inch screen — much larger than the older 9.7-inch iPad.

At the event, I tried out the new products in a demonstration booth. Here are some first impressions: iPhone

The 3D Touch capability is the iPhone's signature new feature. Pressing down on the screen starts different actions, depending on how much force is exerted.

A light press on an email, for example, shows a preview of the message, and a hard press then opens the email. You can also press down hard on an app icon to open shortcuts to different actions — for example, pushing down on the Instagram app shows a list of next steps, including the ability to create a new post. When you press down hard, the device responds with a tapping sensation.

I found the new iPhones pretty straightforward to use. The 3D Touch feature is easy to get used to, and I quickly figured out how to create a new calendar appointment by pressing down hard on the calendar app icon.

The new smartphones are also slightly thicker and heavier than their predecessors, though I confess I noticed that only after reading the specifications on Apple's website and not when holding the devices. iPad

The iPad Pro's jumbo screen obviously gives more room for content to breathe, but interacting with it still feels the same as with older iPad tablets.

The iPad Pro is capable of running two full-size iPad apps on the screen at the same time. The previous iPad Air 2 could run two apps at the same time, but with a primary app taking up a larger portion of the screen.

The large device will be familiar to most because apart from its size, it works the same as previous versions of the tablet. The big-screen iPad also felt comfortable to hold. It weighs about 680 grams, which is the same weight as the very first iPad. Apple TV

The Apple TV is significantly different from past models. The software interface has a white background and vivid colours, similar to Apple's Music app. The new remote control includes a touch pad for scrolling around the menu and a microphone for finding things to watch using Siri, Apple's voice assistant. The remote also includes motion sensors for gaming.

I decided to have some fun by asking Siri to help me navigate content on Apple TV. For example, I tried using Siri to steer a spaceship in a Star Wars game. But that was difficult, perhaps because of my inexperience with the game.

I also tried searching for action movies and comedy movies with the remote control's microphone. Siri misunderstood me when I said ""comedy,"" thinking I had said ""comity."" But it did a better job with action movies — when I said ""show me action movies,"" Siri brought up a list of titles including Mad Max and Furious 7.

The new remote control is thicker than the previous one, and in this case, that's a good thing. The previous Apple TV remote was so thin that it had a tendency to disappear between couch cushions.

"Turkey's foreign trade deficit dropped sharply in August, the Turkish Statistical Institute reported on Wednesday. 
In August, the deficit declined  to $4.88 billion, down from $8.11 billion from same month last year, a drop of 39.8 percent.
