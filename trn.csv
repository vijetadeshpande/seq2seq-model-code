"Taking calcium supplements or eating more dairy to improve bone health has little or no effect, according to new research. 

There is scant evidence that taking calcium supplements prevents fractures and no evidence that increasing calcium through the diet prevents fractures or breaks either, experts said. 

The research, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), collected data from dozens of studies on the issue. 

According to the NHS, adults need 700mg of calcium a day. It is recommended that people get all the calcium they need from their daily diet. 

The NHS Choices website warns that taking  high doses of calcium (over 1,500mg a day) could lead to stomach pain and diarrhoea. 

It says taking supplements containing less than this amount are unlikely to cause any harm. 

In the latest study, experts from New Zealand concluded that efforts to increase calcium intake to improve bone health had no overall effect. 

""Our analyses indicate that dietary calcium intake  is not associated with risk of fracture, and there is no evidence  currently that increasing dietary calcium intake prevents  fractures,"" they said. 

They said calcium supplements have "" an unfavourable  risk:benefit profile"", meaning they could do more harm than good. 

""Collectively, these results suggest that clinicians, advocacy  organisations, and health policymakers should not recommend  increasing calcium intake for fracture prevention, either with  calcium supplements or through dietary sources."" 

The experts studied a range of trials on the issue, including people aged 50 and over getting their calcium from milk or dairy, or taking calcium supplements with or without vitamin D. 

In an accompanying editorial, Professor Karl Michaelsson from Uppsala University in Sweden, said  most over-50s will not benefit from increasing their intake of calcium, particularly through supplements, as some recommendations suggest. 

""The weight of evidence against such mass medication of older people is now compelling, and it is surely time to reconsider these controversial recommendations,"" he said. 

Professor Juliet Compston, a National Osteoporosis Society trustee, said:  ""There is not much in these studies that is new. We already know that calcium supplements increase bone density, but on their own do not reduce fractures. 

""However, a recent analysis concluded that calcium and vitamin D did reduce hip and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women and older men.""",Calcium supplements 'have little effect on bone health'

Singapore’s ruling People’s Action Party of Premier Lee Hsien Loong is set to return to power with absolute majority in the fiercely contested general election, dashing hopes of an emboldened Opposition seeking to end half a century dominance of one-party. 
 
Three People’s Action Party (PAP) candidates have been declared winners and a sample count of the all votes indicated that seven of the eight Opposition parties are unlikely to win a seat in Parliament, the Channel News Asia reported. 
 
PAP candidates Cheryl Chan, Grace Fu and Lam Pin Min have won their respective seat from Fenghan, Yuhua and Sengkang West constituencies. 
 
“The sample count results have been really encouraging across the island, but we don’t want to take them for granted, just as we should never take our residents for granted,” PAP candidate Tan Chuan-Jin was quoted as saying. 
 
Opposition leaders have acknowledged the sample count results, saying there seems to a bigger swing towards the PAP, which has ruled Singapore for 50 years since independence.More than 2 million Singaporeans voted today in one of the biggest general election contest.",Singapore’s ruling party set to return to power

"It was eviction day on Big Brother. And, after a week of pretty much everyone shouting at pretty much everyone else, that meant tough decisions for everyone. 
  
#CBB eviction night! I can't decide who I want out! I hate/love them all! #evictionnight  #UKvsUSA 
 
— Lorraine (@lorrainemaden) September 4, 2015 
  
But before we got to the eviction, we had to suffer through some more shouting. 
 
Big Brother set up a high tea, in which some of the American “servants” were given the task of making the British “royals” angry – leading to one of the most hateful segments of a TV show ever seen. 
 
With Farrah in attendance, there was never any doubt they would succeed. She was throwing around some vile and idiotic insults at anyone and everyone – “retard” and “gay homo” were among the highlights.

In 2010 Nicole Schneit aka Air Waves released Dungeon Dots, an album Aquarius Records called ""…pretty much perfect pop music."" For her new album Parting Glances, Schneit enlisted friends from Brooklyn's music community to contribute to the record, including members of Woods, Crystal Stilts, Ava Luna, and Hospitality. Additionally, Jana Hunter of Lower Dens contributes vocals to two songs. The album's title comes from the 1986 film Parting Glances in which Steve Buscemi portrays a gay man navigating the difficulties of being in a relationship in Reagan-era New York. More than just identifying with the story, Schneit is interested in the in the lasting effect of the parting glances we share with strangers in our everyday encounters. She explains ""You see all sorts of physical and emotional traits on the train. From people puking, making out, screaming, crying, laughing, dancing, grooming, etc. We encounter each other in the thick of our complex lives by simply looking at each other all the time. These glances are mundane and fleeting but also powerfully intimate."" The lingering impact of those brief moments seeps into the details and imagery she delivers with energizing hooks and a disarming lack of pretense on Parting Glances.

        VOL. 39 | NO. 37 | Friday, September 11, 2015 
   
                By Ann M. Job | For the Associated Press  Updated 12:52PM   
Don’t let the Pilot’s new, sleek look fool you. Honda’s largest sport utility vehicle is bigger than ever on the inside, particularly in its third-row seats. 
 
Revamped from roof to tires, the 2016 Pilot shed its boxy exterior and upgraded its interior while adding features and power and is now capable of generating 280 horsepower from its re-engineered and noticeably refined V-6 engine. 
 
It also shed weight, putting this more powerful Pilot at the top in fuel mileage among large three-row gasoline-powered 2016 SUVs. The front-wheel drive 2016 Pilot with a new nine-speed automatic transmission is rated by the federal government at 20 mpg in city driving and 27 mpg on the highway. 
 
There’s even a new top-of-the-line Pilot Elite that comes standard with 20-inch wheels, leather seats and spacious second-row captain’s chairs, as well as the latest safety equipment and luxury-car features like a heated steering wheel. 
 
The starting manufacturer’s suggested retail price, including destination charge, for the 2016 Pilot is $30,875 for a base LX model with front-wheel drive. The lowest starting retail price, including destination charge, for an all-wheel drive Pilot LX is $32,675. 
 
The new Elite model, which has standard all-wheel drive, is priced at $47,300. 
 
The Pilot’s 3.5-liter V-6 engine adds direct injection to help boost horsepower by 30 over last year’s model. Torque is increased by 9, to 262 foot-pounds at 4,700 rpm, and the test-driven model zoomed forward and merged into traffic with surprising ease. 
 2016 Honda Pilot AWD Elite  
BASE PRICE: $29,995 for FWD LX; $31,795 for AWD LX; $32,430 for FWD EX; $34,230 for AWD EX; $35,905 for FWD EX-L; $37,705 for AWD EX-L; $41,020 for FWD Touring; $42,820 for AWD Touring; $46,420 for AWD Elite. 
 
PRICE AS TESTED: $42,225. 
 
TYPE: Front-engine, all-wheel drive, seven-passenger, large sport utility vehicle. 
 
ENGINE: 3.5-liter, single overhead cam, direct injection V-6 with i-VTEC and variable cylinder management. 
 
MILEAGE: 19 mpg (city), 26 mpg (highway). 
 
TOP SPEED: NA. 
 
LENGTH: 194.5 inches. 
 
WHEELBASE: 111 inches. 
 
CURB WEIGHT: 4,317 pounds. 
 
BUILT AT: Lincoln, Ala. 
 
OPTIONS: None. 
 
DESTINATION CHARGE: $880. 
 
The Associated Press 

With the nine-speed transmission, which is only available on the Touring and Elite models and was in the test-driven Pilot Elite, the engine is surprisingly quiet and vibration-free. Lower trim levels get the carryover six-speed automatic, which reduces fuel mileage numbers by 1 mpg. 
 
It’s easy for a driver to forget just how large the new Pilot is because at more than 16 feet long, it feels remarkably light. The lighter weight - now starting at just over 4,000 pounds - and stiffer structure make the 2016 Pilot feel solid and stable but not ponderous. 
 
The test-driven model was quiet inside and its supple leather seats and steering wheel wrap, soft-touch interior plastics, side-door sunscreens and 8-inch touchscreen display added to its luxurious feel. The big screen crisply displayed the view from the Pilot’s backup camera. 
 
The Elite also comes standard with a panoramic roof and four USB ports, and passengers marveled that so many luxury features could come with a Honda SUV. 
 
The ride was comfortable, with the large SUV maintaining a smooth ride as it drove over bumps in the road. And its large, 20-inch wheels didn’t transmit any heaviness to those inside. 
 
A new one-touch feature helps passengers get into the third-row seat. Just push a button and a second-row seat automatically tilts and slides to its forward-most position. The second-row seat then can return to its midpoint setting. 
 
The Pilot’s third row is easier to access because the step-in is 1.2 inches lower and 2.5 inches wider than before. The third row also has a new, three-position recline feature, and the 38.9 inches of headroom back there is more than what’s in the back seat of a Toyota Camry. The Pilot’s 31.9 inches of third-row legroom can accommodate adults and surpasses what’s in the Kia Sorento and Toyota Highlander third rows. 
 
The 2016 Pilot can tow up to 5,000 pounds. Every model comes with six airbags, antilock brakes, brake-assist and electronic stability control. Top trim levels of Touring and Elite add the latest forward collision and lane departure warning and collision mitigation system, among other things. 
 
In July, 1,358 new Pilots were recalled because third-row seatbelts might be trapped between the seat and sideliner, making them difficult to use.","New Honda Pilot looks smaller, adds interior space"
"Nobody in baseball history had as many choices in World Series jewelry as Yogi Berra, who died Tuesday at age 90. Berra won a record 10 championship rings, and the one he wore most often in later years was from 1953. It had the number 5 on its face -- with the lower part of the numeral encircling a diamond -- to signify the Yankees' fifth title in a row. Berra said he wore that ring because no other team, before or since, had accomplished that feat. Berra had 71 hits in the World Series, a record, and nine of them came against the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1956. He hit a grand slam off Don Newcombe in the Yankees' Game 2 loss, went 5 for 15 over the next four games, and then hit two more home runs off Newcombe in Game 7. Berra drilled two-run home runs in the first and the third innings, propelling the Yankees to a 9-0 victory. It was a bitter end to a dream season for Newcombe, who was 27-7 and won the Cy Young Award (then given to only one pitcher in the majors) and the NL Most Valuable Player Award. When Newcombe came to bat after the second home run, Berra consoled him from behind the plate. ""I hit a pretty good pitch, Newk,"" Berra told him, according to an account in The New York Times. ""Yes, you did,"" Newcombe replied. Berra remains the only player to hit two home runs in a winner-take-all World Series game, and his 10 runs batted in and .800 slugging percentage in 1956 were career highs in his 14 Series appearances. But the car presented to the World Series MVP went to Don Larsen for his perfect game in Game 5. It was Berra, though, who gave us an indelible snapshot of that moment by leaping into Larsen's arms after the final out. The unforgettable image of spontaneous joy defined the boyish enthusiasm for baseball that Berra kept all his life.

This summer’s transfer window may have been a profitable one for Liverpool, but Brendan Rodgers is already turning his attentions to next year’s market. 
 
That’s according to reports that suggest the Reds continue to send scouts to watch Real Betis midfielder Dani Ceballos, ahead of a possible bid for his services in the future. 
 
The youngster has less than a year remaining on his contract and a buy-out clause of £7.5million, with Liverpool having the option to attempt to purchase him for a cut-price fee in January. 
 

 
It’s said they will face competition from Arsenal, with Ceballos looking likely to sign a pre-contract agreement for an English move next year. 
 Balotelli's Real joke  
Meanwhile Mario Balotelli has admitted that Real Madrid are a ‘dream club’, refuting reports that he made a joke about them in the past. 
 
The Italian took to Twitter to slam those who said he had aimed a dig at Real via a statement about Barcelona, claiming he would never make fun of Los Blancos. 
 Rooney on Sterling  
Bringing up the rear Wayne Rooney has had his say on Raheem Sterling’s controversial Anfield departure, and he has backed it. 
 

 
The Manchester United forward said that he thought Sterling seemed ‘settled’ at Man City and had started the season excellenty. That can only mean good things for the Three Lions.

Facing their most important 40 minutes of the year, the visitors made an encouraging start to the second period. Adam Higson and Fuifui Moimoi touched down within nine minutes of the re-start to reduce their arrears to just eight points. 
 
But that was close as Leigh came to following up last week’s encouraging victory over Sheffield Eagles. 
 
Halifax steadied their nerves to put the game out of reach with tries from Scott Murrell and Ste Tyrer.

"Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals and became Real Madrid's all-time top scorer in the Primera Division as he inspired Los Blancos to a thumping 6-0 win at Espanyol. 

The Portugal forward's impressive haul saw him move ahead of Alfredo di Stefano and Raul in one afternoon to amass a total of 229 goals in 203 matches - one ahead of Raul, who needed 550 games to reach his tally. 

Ronaldo, who had failed to score in either of Madrid's opening league games, needed just seven minutes to open his account against Espanyol, having bagged a treble here last season. He promptly scored again from the penalty spot and then completed his hat-trick on 20 minutes with the help of a cross from Gareth Bale. 

Karim Benzema added a fourth before the break, and then in the second half Bale again laid on the pass for Ronaldo to strike for the fourth time and make Real Madrid history. But he was still not done, converting again from inside the area on 80 minutes.",Five-goal Cristiano Ronaldo becomes Real Madrid's all-time top scorer in La Liga
"Listening to politicians campaigning you a picture you get is that after October, Tanzanians will be living in heaven. Candidates’ promises paints a flawless Tanzania in which no one will labour for anything. 

If you critically look at things which politicians in the campaign trail promise they are going to accomplish if elected, you will be petrified. Anyone with sober mind will be horrified and left wondering on how and when these politicians are going to fulfil these pledges. 

It seems also that even those who are defending their seats have forgotten that in 2010 they issued a lot of promises majority of which they have not accomplished. They now go out to dish out even more promises.  

While Mwalimu Nyerere used to tell Tanzanians that they will develop only through hard work, our candidates are competing to show that they have solutions to all problems and these solutions do not entail people working, let alone working hard, to resolve their problems. 

Candidates are promising each and everything but none of them have been heard telling Tanzanians that they will have to toil for them to earn their daily bread. 

Making promises to the effect that people will not be required to work in order to better their lives amounts to making them complacent. And this will not only affect the individuals but the entire nation. For the nation to make strides it needs hard working people who will be able to first change their personal lives and then contribute for the national economy. 

Crave for victory should not blind the candidates and push them to give promises which in actual fact are not reasonable. We should only look back into 2010 and take stock of what was promised and what has been accomplished for us to be able to gauge what promising mean to the individuals and the nation. 

The promises we have been hearing would need a lot of money to be implemented. But we are not told where this money will come from. Other candidates have started to cite natural gas as one source of money with which they will accomplish their promises. But we know that a better expert’s guess is that the next leadership will leave the office before the country starts to see real money from the natural gas. So, there is no point in cheating the public that gas will provide enough money for implementation of these many plans which we are hearing. 

Politicians should campaign knowing that this country or its people are not going to end tomorrow. They should practice considerate politics which respect the fact that cheating would only give them satisfaction but subject the country and its people to pointless argony.

"The fuel economy and smog ratings are shown on the sticker price of a 2015 Passat limited edition vehicle at a Volkswagen dealership in Escondido, California, September 21, 2015. — Reuters pic FRANKFURT, Sept 22 — German auto giant Volkswagen’s shares plummeted nearly 20 per cent yesterday as investigations spread into revelations that hundreds of thousands of its diesel cars have software that secretly thwarts US pollution tests. 
 
Volkswagen, the world’s largest automaker by sales in the first half of this year, said it had halted all diesel vehicle sales in the United States during a probe into the scandal, which could lead to fines of more than US$18 billion (RM76.786 billion). 
 
In addition to the environmental fines, US authorities have reportedly launched a criminal investigation into the company. 
 
According to the US authorities, VW admitted that it had equipped about 482,000 cars in the US with sophisticated software that covertly turns off pollution controls when the car is being driven and turns them on only when it detects that the car is undergoing an emissions test. 
 
With the so-called “defeat device” deactivated, the car can spew pollutant gases into the air, including nitrogen oxide in amounts as much as 40 per cent higher than emissions standards, said the US Environmental Protection Agency, which announced the allegations Friday along with California authorities. 
 
“Using a defeat device in cars to evade clean air standards is illegal, and a threat to public health,” said Cynthia Giles, enforcement officer at the EPA. 
 
In Germany, currently hosting the Frankfurt motor show vaunting the industry’s strengths and environmental credentials, the government launched an investigation into whether Volkswagen or other carmakers are doing anything similar in Germany or Europe. 
 
Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt told the Bild daily that he had asked Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority “to immediately have specific and extensive tests conducted on all Volkswagen diesel models by independent experts.” 
 
South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said that authorities there, too, would conduct emissions tests on three Volkswagen car models in mid-October to check for similar deception. 
 
Beyond the potential fines and lawsuits, and the billions of euros that evaporated in Volkswagen’s stock market value as its shares plunged 18.19 per cent to €133 (RM635), wiping out more than US$15 billion, the company faces a potentially crippling blow to its reputation. 
 
 Criminal probe launched 
 
The vehicles affected are four-cylinder VW and Audi diesel cars in the US built since 2008. 
 
In addition to the EPA’s probe, the US Department of Justice has launched a criminal investigation into the German automaker’s alleged violation of US air pollution laws, according to media reports yesterday. 
 
First reported by Bloomberg, the criminal probe piles more pressure on VW. 
 
Contacted by AFP, neither the Justice Department nor Volkswagen chose to comment on the probe. 
 
The EPA said that the agency had not issued a formal recall for the VW vehicles but expects to “compel” the company to issue a recall to reduce the emissions impacts of those vehicles. 
 
“Depending on the complexity of the repair and the lead time needed to obtain the necessary components, it could take up to one year to identify corrective actions, develop a recall plan, and issue recall notices,” the US agency said. 
 
The EPA also said yesterday that it will screen for defeat devices in other manufacturers’ diesel vehicles currently on the road, though declined to identify the automakers whose vehicles will be tested. 
 
 Deeply sorry 
 
VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn issued an apology Sunday, vowing that the group would cooperate with authorities and ordering an external investigation of its own into the matter. 
 
“The board of management takes these findings very seriously. I personally am deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public. We will cooperate fully with the responsible agencies, with transparency and urgency, to clearly, openly and completely establish all of the facts of this case,” Winterkorn said. 
 
“We at Volkswagen will do everything that must be done in order to re-establish the trust that so many people have placed in us, and we will do everything necessary in order to reverse the damage this has caused. This matter has first priority for me, personally, and for our entire board of management,” Winterkorn said. 
 
Christian Stadler of Warwick Business School said there was “no question that this is a big problem for Volkswagen and could lead to CEO Winterkorn losing his job after all.” 
 
Winterkorn, 68, has been chief executive since 2007, but clashed with other leadership earlier this year. 
 
 Image damaged 
 
Stefan Bratzel, director at the Center for Automotive Management, a research group, said the damage to VW’s image would be as great as the financial fines. 
 
Another leading German auto expert, Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, agreed.  
 
“It will be tough for VW to regain its credibility in the United States after this incident,” he said. 
 
In the US, Edmunds.com analyst Jessica Caldwell said “it is in Volkswagen’s best interest to publicly address steps to fix this mess as soon as possible before it loses its customer base for good.” 
 
German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel expressed confidence that VW would clear up the matter quickly and thoroughly.  
 
And he insisted the reputation of “Made in Germany” technology would not be tarnished. — AFP",Criminal probe: Volkswagen slams into huge false emission scam

"Rocker Ryan Adams said covering Taylor Swift's entire ""1989"" album was ""incredibly humbling"" and helped him explore himself more deeply as a musician. 

Adams' version of ""1989"" was digitally released Monday. Swift released the original album — her first full-blown pop record — last October. 

""It's actually incredibly humbling to find a connection with someone else's words and someone else's songs and to open yourself up and to feel them fully, and find out where those stories take you,"" Adams, 40, said in an interview last week. ""It felt no less genuine than any song I've ever written for myself."" 

So far, Swift's fifth album has sold 5.2 million units and launched multiple hits, including No.1s like ""Shake It Off,"" ""Blank Space"" and ""Bad Blood."" Adams' interpretation of ""1989"" offers a slowed-down take on her upbeat anthems. 

""I got to work different parts of my brain, different parts of my heart and different parts of the musical aspects of my personality,"" Adams said of covering Swift's music. ""It's really its own thing. ...It's not the same record."" 

After completing his version, the singer-songwriter-producer played it for 25-year-old Swift before taking it any further. He namedropped Bob Mould as one his favorite musicians, but added in the same breath: ""But then I also love all those songs on (Swift's) 'Fearless' (album). I don't really have a place where my music begins and ends."" 

Adams said he has known Swift for about 4 years and counts himself as a fan. 

Adams released his debut album, ""Heartbreaker,"" in 2000. His 2014 self-titled record, his 14th studio release, earned him two Grammy nominations earlier this year, including best rock album. He has also found success as a producer for acts like Willie Nelson and Jenny Lewis. 

Adams says in 1989 — the year, not the album — he remembers being in love with music and being aware he wanted to make a career out of it. 

""I was already collecting albums. By 15, I was skateboarding, I had gotten my first guitar,"" he said. ""I had my first record player and I remember I got my first couple of real albums that were my own records and I was really excited about them.""

United Nations Human Rights Chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein at yesterday's briefing on UNHRC Report on Sri Lanka. Dharisha Bastians 
reporting from Geneva
The United Nations Human Rights Chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein has called for the setting up of a special ‘hybrid court’ comprising international judges and prosecutors after a report by his Office revealed “horrific” violations strongly indicating that war crimes were most likely committed by both government forces and the LTTE and declared the country’s justice system incapable of dealing with the seriousness of the crimes.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights yesterday released the long awaited report of an investigation by his office, into allegations that war crimes had been committed during the final stages of the Sri Lankan conflict.
Indiscriminate shelling, extra judicial killings, enforced disappearances, “harrowing accounts” of torture and sexual violence, recruitment of children and other grave crimes had been laid bare in the report, the UN High Commissioner said.
As he made the 261 page report public, Zeid said Sri Lanka’s justice system was not up to the task of dealing with such grave violations.
“The inescapable reality is that Sri Lanka’s criminal justice system is not ready to handle these types of crimes,” High Commissioner Zeid told a news conference at the Palais des Nations in Geneva yesterday. Zeid said the report had highlighted “years of denials and coverups”, the failure to carry out investigations and reprisals against those calling for justice. The High Commissioner said that domestic mechanisms of the past had suffered ‘repeated failures” to bring justice to victims, leading to skepticism, anger and mistrust on the part of victims. “Many of the structures responsible for the violations and crimes remain in place,” the High Commissioner noted.
The hybrid special court would deepen national importance while at the same time maintain international focus on Sri Lanka, High Commissioner Zeid explained.
The commitment by the new Government to pursue accountability through a domestic process was commendable, Zeid said, adding that “unfortunately, Sri Lanka’s criminal justice system is not yet ready”.
The High Commissioner told reporters that the absence of reliable witness protection, the inadequacy of the country’s legal framework and the “degree to which the country’s security sector and judicial system had been corrupted by decades of emergency, conflict and impunity” posed challenges to achieving justice for victims.
The High Commissioner noted that the investigation had been hindered by the fact that the Sri Lankan Government did not support the probe for almost entire length of the inquiry.
“We were hampered by the inability to access the very people we needed to meet the most - victims in Sri Lanka,” Zeid said.
Hailing victims and survivors for the courage of their testimony that contributed to the 261 page, two-part report, the UN High Commissioner said he hoped the report would inspire change that many Sri Lankans had been “aching” for.
“Sri Lanka will never escape the stinging tentacles of its past unless victims receive justice and redress,” the UN Rights Chief told journalists.
The High Commissioner said he hoped the UN Human Rights Council which is sitting in its 30th Session this month, will endorse the recommendations in the report. In response to a question posed by Daily FT about whether his office would urge the inclusion of the hybrid court in the draft resolution on Sri Lanka at the end of the session, Zeid said consultations on the draft were not yet underway.
I will expect that there will be a careful reading of the report the shorter summary and the longer report. My hope is that the Human Rights Council will endorse the recommendations we have placed in our report. Since we have not had consultations on the draft yet, it is a discussion to come. Our hope is that the recommendation will be accepted and adopted by principally by the Government of Sri Lanka but that the Human Rights Council will see fit to support the recommendations,” he said.
Zeid strongly recommended vetting for security and military officials from Sri Lanka proposed for international peacekeeping missions or military exchanges. “It is absolutely clear given the findings in this report that there must be a great deal of soul-searching if the Sri Lanka is going to ensure non-recurrence. One would hope that within the security services, there will be a recognition that these methods were they to be proven in a court of law, do not bring greater stability to a country. It only brings more suffering and creates more victims,” the High Commissioner said.
The High Commissioner took pains to note that the investigation carried out by his office was a human rights investigation and not a criminal investigation. But he said it marked the beginning of a judicial process to confirm that war crimes and crimes against humanity had been committed by state actors and the LTTE and paramilitary groups during the Sri Lankan war.
Zeid said his office hoped this report would lead to efforts to end impunity for these crimes and create “a most intense reckoning with the past.”
“The recognition that there are simply too many families throughout Sri Lanka that have suffered appallingly, too many who have disappeared, too many pushed into exile, too many funerals organised, too much pain felt and too much lost in terms of Sri Lanka’s human and economic potential, for the past not to be stared down, not to be learnt from and atoned for,” the High Commissioner said.
The OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL) conducted by a team of seven investigators and three special advisors, found evidence of extra-judicial killings and indiscriminate shelling by Government forces with the use of long range weapons. The report said investigators also found evidence that top LTTE commanders had prevented civilians from leaving the battle zones in the Northern Province and said the Tigers had repeatedly set up military fortifications near civilian areas and medical facilities. In a particularly interesting finding, the OISL report revealed that it had documented extensive recruitment of children in armed conflict by the LTTE which intensified during the final months of the conflict. The OISL also found that the Karuna group had recruited children after its split from the LTTE in 2004.
“Based on the information gathered by OISL there are reasonable grounds to believe that Government security forces may have known that the Karuna group recruited children in areas under their control,” the report states.
The findings, if proven amount to a contravention of the UN convention on rights of the child and its optional protocol and would constitute a war crime if proven in a court of law, the report said.
As the High Commissioner issued his statement about the release of the report, victim families from North, East and South of Sri Lanka sat outside Press Room III of the Palais des Nations, watching his remarks on the live webcast. Zeid acknowledged the women as he left the press room following his news conference. Govt. assures ‘due attention’ to UN war crimes report In what the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Spokesman Rupert Colville called a “cordial response”, the Government of Sri Lanka replied the OISL report, noting that it was not a criminal investigation and pledging to give it “due attention”.
The communiqué expresses the Government’s commitment to ensuring non-recurrence and pledges wide consultations with stakeholders and victims.
The following is the full text of the Government’s response to the UN report.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka presents its compliments to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and with reference to the latter’s Note dated 10 September 2015 conveying an unedited advance copy of the Report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (A/HRC/30/61) and the Report of the OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL) (A/HRC/30/SRP.2) has the honour to submit the following comments:
The Government of Sri Lanka,
*Takes note of the Report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (A/HRC/30/61), and the recommendations made by the High Commissioner;
*Is pleased and encouraged by the High Commissioner’s recognition of the efforts of the new Government since the Presidential election of 8 January 2015 in dealing with issues of concern for the people of Sri Lanka relating to human rights, rule of law, governance, justice, institutional and legal reform and reconciliation;
*Appreciates the due recognition given to the Government’s constructive engagement with the High Commissioner and OHCHR aimed at addressing post-conflict issues that impact on achieving reconciliation;
*Remains firm in its conviction to take all possible measures to ensure non-recurrence in keeping with the mandate given by the people of the country twice this year, 2015, at the Presidential election in January and the Parliamentary election in August;
*Will ensure dialogue and wide consultations with all stakeholders especially the victims of conflict, communities, political parties, civil society representatives, the military as well as the High Commissioner and his Office, bilateral partners, and other international organistions in putting in place mechanisms and measures that will facilitate the right to know, right to justice, reparations and guaranteeing non-recurrence with the aim of achieving reconciliation and durable peace to ensure long-term progress of all her citizens;
*Takes note also of the Report of the OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL), recognises fully that this Report represents a human rights investigation and not a criminal investigation, and will ensure that its content as well as recommendations receive due attention of the relevant authorities including the new mechanisms that are envisaged to be set up;
*Remains open to continuing its engagement with the High Commissioner and his Office as well as the systems and procedures of the Human Rights Council, aimed at taking steps to safeguard and uphold the human rights of all her citizens.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the assurances of its highest consideration. TNA hails report; calls for introspection within Tamil community The Tamil National Alliance strongly welcomed the OISL report released yesterday, particularly the report’s recommendation for the establishment of a hybrid court and the incorporation of international crimes into Sri Lanka’s laws so that prosecutions could take place. TNA Lawmaker and Spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran told Daily FT at the Palais des Nations in Geneva that the party hoped the Government would accept the UN report.
Sumanthiran said the Foreign Minister in his address to the Human Rights Council this week had noted that that there was a new Sri Lanka in which things would be different.
“Sri Lanka must now stand up and accept this report and work with the world community. To that extent, we ask the 47 Member States in the Human Rights Council to adopt all the recommendations in the OISL report as a resolution. We ask the Government of Sri Lanka to agree to that so that we can go forward with one aim. To deal with the past properly, in a manner that will assuage the feelings of the victims and having dealt with the past in a meaningful way to move forward into a bright future for all of Sri Lanka’s people,” the TNA Parliamentarian urged.
He also urged soul-searching within the Tamil community, about the community’s own failures. “We ask the Tamil people of Sri Lanka also to use this moment as a moment of introspection into our own community’s failures and create the right culture and atmosphere in which we can live with dignity and self-respect, as equal citizens of Sri Lanka,” Sumanthiran said. (DB) Namal claims UN suggestion an insult   MP Namal Rajapaksa yesterday in a tweet claimed that the OHCR’s call for the creation of a hybrid court in Sri Lanka was a “complete insult to the entire legal system of the country.” He said Sri Lanka is fully capable of conducting any domestic inquiry that is needed.
“The double standards practiced by sections of the international community is injustice in itself. Sri Lanka courts have already demonstrated they have resources and capability to conduct credible investigations within existing legal framework,” he added. - See more at: http://www.ft.lk/article/471779/“Hybrid”-healer-for-“horrors” #sthash.1GL12x9S.dpuf",“Hybrid” healer for “horrors”
"Tony Abbott's last word  
Watch the last press conference of outgoing Prime Minister Tony Abbott in full. 
 PT6M11S   620  349    

They're the power couple who have run the Liberal Party back-room operation since December 2009. 

But Tony Abbott's ousting as prime minister will inevitably lead to his high-profile chief of staff, Peta Credlin, quitting the blue carpet in Parliament House's ministerial wing. 
 
Peta Credlin and Brian Loughnane arrive for the Midwinter Ball at Parliament House in June. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  
  
What will happen to her husband, long-serving Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, is less clear. 
 
Ms Credlin worked for Malcolm Turnbull during his stint as opposition leader in 2008-09, but the pair did not always see eye to eye and she will not be working for the incoming leader. 

After her time with Mr Turnbull, Ms Credlin became the dominant figure in the Abbott government, described as a controlling co-prime minister by her critics, lauded by her allies — not least Mr Abbott, who called her the ""fiercest political warrior I've ever worked with"".  As chief of staff, she became one of the most high-profile staffers in recent political history. 
 
From the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Peta Credlin was in the room as one of his most trusted lieutenants. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  
  
From the first days of the Abbott opposition in December 2009, Ms Credlin was in the room as one of the opposition leader's most trusted lieutenants alongside press secretaries and advisers Andrew Hirst and Claire Kimball, honing and refining Mr Abbott's laser-like attack on Kevin Rudd's carbon pollution reduction scheme. 

After just less than four years in opposition,  in September 2013, Ms Credlin, a lawyer with years of experience in the Howard government, made the transition as chief of staff into government. 

But the tightly controlled approach adopted in opposition did not work as smoothly in government.

Public complaints about a "" command and control "" approach taken by the prime minister's office quickly surfaced, and a reliance on slogans that worked in opposition did not cut through in government. 

In February 2015, when Mr Abbott faced a spill motion in the party room, some MPs were calling for a shake-up of the prime minister's office, and for political veteran Tony Nutt to be brought into the office. 

Ms Credlin disappeared from public view, for a time, but the complaints soon resurfaced. 
 
Brian Loughnane has been federal director of the Liberal Party since 2003. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen  
  
But Mr Abbott refused suggestions of change to his office: in his farewell speech, he singled out his chief of staff  ""who has been unfairly maligned by people who should've known better"". 

And now, both exit the political centre stage, at least for a time. 

Mr Loughnane, meanwhile, has been federal director of the Liberal Party since February 2003 and party strategists told Fairfax Media on Tuesday that, if possible, he should continue in the role. 

One veteran pointed out that Mr Turnbull and Mr Loughnane had worked together before, during Mr Turnbull's stint as opposition leader, and that a change in director was not ""necessary or inevitable"". 

That veteran also said the prime minister's office would likely benefit from a bit of ""competitive tension"" between it and Liberal Party HQ. 

""It depends on the relationship between the two of them; [Mr Loughnane] has served every leader since Howard.      But Malcolm will have to be comfortable with the director – you can't have a situation like [former prime minister] Paul Keating and [former ALP secretary] Gary Gray [in 1996]."" 

A second Liberal veteran said Ms Credlin was ""very talented and a good manager, but it will be hard for her to stay in the show. I do hope Brian stays on. The most important thing is corporate knowledge and experience."" 

Fairfax Media sought comment from Ms Credlin and Mr Loughnane. 

On Tuesday, Mr Turnbull also began the process of putting together his office team. 

The former secretary of the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, and of the Communications Department, Drew Clarke, will serve as his acting chief of staff, while Mr Nutt, who worked closely with Turnbull backer Senator Arthur Sinodinos in the office of John Howard, will return to Canberra to help manage the transition to the prime ministership. 

Senator Sinodinos confirmed on Tuesday that Mr Turnbull would seek to emulate the attitude of Mr Howard as prime minister by taking a team approach, ""and have a number of senior people in there who can provide advice and make sure it's an open prime minister's office, it's accessible and that there are tributaries of advice going to the prime minister,"" he told Sky News. 

""The role of the office is not to be a gatekeeper and cut people off; the role of the office has to be a facilitator of contact so the prime minister knows and has early warning of whether there are concerns. 

""You don't need the polls if you have backbenchers who are frank and willing to tell you what is going on.""

The market will be more like Le District than Gansevoort Market , with a Vongerichten wonderland of chowder, sushi and raw bars driven by nostalgia for Fulton Street Fish Market, which moved uptown to the Bronx. The seafront restaurant will also be low-key instead of fine dining, with a quarter of its square footage devoted to a patio. 

Other upcoming food hall projects in the works include Danny Meyer’s Hudson Yards behemoth , while Anthony Bourdain is looking to colonize the “SuperPier” on the west side with a 100,000-square-foot dystopian Asian-style market . A new branch of Eataly is also set to open downtown this winter.",South Street Seaport is getting a seafood-themed food hall
"The Federal Savings Bank encourages all prospective home buyers and mortgage applicants to do the math and see just how much less expensive owning is versus renting.    Past News Releases RSS    
 Chicago, IL (PRWEB)  September 15, 2015  

Lenders like The Federal Savings Bank are always keeping tabs on rental markets across the USA.  Strong rental markets usually also contain strong real estate markets. 
 
The Federal Savings Bank was intrigued by data released in a CNN Money article from August 19th titled “ America's most expensive rental markets ”. 
 
Perhaps surprisingly, 10 out of the 15 markets presented resided in California.  Due to the abundance of tech companies and high salaries, Cali is the most abundantly expensive state to live in terms of rents. 
 
The average percentage of income spent on rent in all 10 California cities was above 40% for: Salinas, San Luis Obispo, San Diego, Santa Rosa, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Napa, Santa Cruz, San Francisco, and San Jose.  Above 40% is a very high level.  For Los Angeles, where the median income is $61,482, the average percentage of income spent on rent is 48.9%. Just think of how much money could be saved by owning instead of renting! 
 
Washington D.C. while expensive at a $2,104 per month level of rent, showed the lowest percentage of income spent on rent at just 26.8% thanks to high median incomes of the area at $94,204. 
 
The Federal Savings Bank believes high costing rental markets are places that give an incentive to first-time home buyers the most to purchase a property.  With home prices on the rise and 30-year fixed mortgage rates continuing to trend sub 4%, now is an affordable time to purchase a property. 
 
The Federal Savings Bank encourages all prospective home buyers and mortgage applicants to do the math and see just how much less expensive owning is versus renting.  Frequently, the cost of a mortgage + property taxes + association fees are less than the monthly cost of rent!

"West Brom have rejected a third bid from Tottenham for Saido Berahino, Press Association Sport understands. 
 
The offer, which arrived late on Tuesday, was only marginally better than Spurs' previous bid, which would have only risen to £21million with clauses and add-ons. 
 
The Baggies have instantly dismissed Tottenham's third approach and remain determined to keep the England Under-21 striker at The Hawthorns. 
 
Berahino had a transfer request rejected last month with Albion angered by Tottenham's continued pursuit of the 22-year-old. 
 
The Baggies are understood to be unhappy with Spurs' approach to the deal which has only strengthened their resolve to keep Berahino. 
 
The forward has been left out of West Brom's last three squads during the speculation with boss Tony Pulis insisting he was not in the right state of mind to play.

Davis Follow @allisonpdavis No photos over six hours old allowed. 37 Shares Share 29 Tweet 8 Share 0 Pin It 0 Share Email Print Share Photo: Uwe Umstaetter/Westend61/Corbis The best photo of me was taken about a few years ago: I will never again look so young, so free, or so skinny as I was in that shot. Do I still use that fairly blatant misrepresentation of my current self on my OKCupid profile? You bet I do.  Unfortunately, a Swedish dating site called 7Heaven wants to ruin my internet game by only hosting photos of members that were taken in the last six hours. It can check timestamps. Don't even try to trick it; it's smarter than us.   Users can upload new ones as they want to, but only if they were recently snapped. It doesn’t matter who you are now — bald, chubby, with bad bangs, a bad haircut, or a new tattoo — 7Heaven only wants that authentic, current self presented to potential suitors. That seems like so much work! Trying to get yourself dating-site-selfie-ready every six hours?
At first I thought, Chill out! How much does a person actually change in six hours? But then I remembered the disparity between how I look at work and how I look when I come home at night, take off my pants, remove my makeup, and fall asleep on the couch for a few hours before I start Tindering. Maybe six hours is too long a time period.

"Supporters of secessionist group Junts Pel Si celebrate after polls closed in a regional parliamentary election in Barcelona that saw separatists win a clear majority of seats in Catalonia's parliament. 
             
Separatists have won a clear majority of seats in Catalonia's parliament, an exit poll showed on Sunday, in an election that could set the region on a collision course with Spain's central government over independence. 
 
The main secessionist group ""Junts pel Si"" (Together for Yes) would get between 63 and 66 seats in the 135-strong assembly, while smaller leftist party CUP would secure another 11 to 13 seats, according to the poll released by local broadcaster TV3, the largest carried out. 
 
They would jointly obtain 49.8 per cent of the vote, amid a an expected record turnout, in what would be a big boost to a secession campaign which has been losing support over the last two years. 
 
""Junts pel Si"" and CUP had said before the vote that such a result would allow them to unilaterally declare independence within 18 months, under a plan that would see the new Catalan authorities approving their own constitution and building institutions like an army, central bank and judicial system. 
 
The Spanish centre-right government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, which has opposed attempts to hold a referendum on secession, has called the breakaway plan ""a nonsense"" and vowed to block it in court. Spain's constitution does not allow any region to break away. 
 
Catalan secession remains highly hypothetical, but the strong pro-independence showing is a blow for Rajoy less than three months before a countrywide election. 
 
It also creates additional uncertainty over potential talks over a more favourable tax regime and laws that better protect language and culture, which analysts say are needed to soothe Catalan discontent. 
 
Many of the 5.5 million voters had said on Sunday that they did not believe Catalonia would become independent and had used their ballot as a way to press the Catalan and Spanish authorities to discuss those issues.

"With his home run in the third inning Saturday, Joc Pederson climbed the franchise leaderboard for most home runs by a rookie: 

Mike Piazza	1993	35 Joc Pederson	2015	25 Del Bissonette	1928	25 
    
PHOENIX >> Corey Seager’s torrid start isn’t enough to guarantee the rookie shortstop a spot in the Dodgers’ starting lineup once Jimmy Rollins returns. Rollins has been unable to hit or play the field in five games this week because of a tender right index finger. 

Meanwhile Seager is batting .448 with an on-base percentage of.568 through his first nine major league games. He went 4 for 4 with a home run and stole a base in the Dodgers’ win Saturday. He’s reached base in all nine of his plate appearances the last two days. 
  
Once Rollins returns, however, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said the plan for Seager “always has been to play him some at short and give Jimmy days, give (Justin Turner) days at third. He’s played more than we thought from the standpoint of injuries and he’s done a good job. 

While he’s been praised for his defense and leadership, Rollins also ranks last among qualified National League shortstops in batting average (.220) and on-base percentage (.279). 

The 36-year-old is available to pinch run, but hasn’t been cleared to bat or play the field. Mattingly said there’s no timetable for Rollins to return. 
  
Seager, meanwhile, continues to impress. His home run was the second-hardest hit by a Dodger this season at 110 mph. 

“He just doesn’t make me nervous,” Mattingly said. “He’s got that (Adrian Gonzalez) heartbeat. It’s slow. He’ll live to be 108, I bet.” 

Mattingly has shunned any questions about potential playoff roster scenarios so far. But with the Dodgers’ magic number to clinch the division nearing single digits (14), the battle for the final NLDS roster spots will soon be a main focal point of the season. 
  
Even if he doesn’t supplant Rollins as the starting shortstop this season, Seager could still make an impact as a reserve. 

“He’s going to be really good,” Mattingly said, “and he is really good.” 
Puig not in the house 
Why isn’t Yasiel Puig at Chase Field? 

Good question. 

“I expected him to be here, honestly,” Mattingly said. 

Puig is rehabbing a strained right hamstring at Camelback Ranch in nearby Glendale. He hasn’t played since Aug. 27. While the team hasn’t reported any setbacks in Puig’s rehab, “he’s not working out on the field; he’s working out in water and the Alter-G.” 
 
 
  
As baseball activities go, Puig isn’t doing any less than pitcher Brandon McCarthy, for one, who’s out for the season following Tommy John surgery on his right elbow. But McCarthy is with his teammates in the clubhouse and the dugout during games. 

Puig, who’s rehabbing a half-hour away, is not. 

“Everybody’s invited,” Mattingly said. “All I’m saying is he’s welcome.” 

Mattingly said that Puig will return to Los Angeles with the team when it flies home tomorrow night. 
Also 
Kiké Hernandez (strained left hamstring) ran on the field prior to the game. … Howie Kendrick (strained left hamstring) will get 10 at-bats Monday and Tuesday at Dodger Stadium in live batting practice. He is still unable to run at full speed, though “his time was pretty good, faster than the day before,” according to Mattingly. … Condolences to the family of Dodger Stadium chef Dave Pearson, who died at age 75. He had been battling lung cancer.",Corey Seager's days as the Dodgers' starting shortstop are numbered

"NBC's new drama The Player  has one of the most ridiculous premises of any of the new fall TV shows -- but that's not a bad thing. Unlike so many of the shows trying to ""cut through the clutter"" with a splashy concept, The Player knows exactly what it wants to be: a high-octane crime thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously. And it shouldn't with a setup like this: Alex Kane ( Philp Winchester ) is a private security specialist in Las Vegas who, after the murder of his wife Ginny ( Daisy Betts ), is pulled into a long-running conspiracy involving the richest people in the world gambling on crime. With the help of ""pit boss"" Mr. Johnson ( Wesley Snipes ) and ""the dealer"" Cassandra ( Charity Wakefield ), Alex, as ""the player,"" tries to stop crimes while the fat cats in ""the house"" bet on or against his ability to save the day. Got all that? ""We knew we wanted to make a pulp show,"" co-creator John Rogers tells TVGuide.com . ""The way pulp works is to find a good, simple, defining metaphor, and we said, 'What are the elements of gambling?' If you're going to have a conspiracy, you're going to have code names, you're going to a have a structure. When we looked at the basic form of gambling, the feel of a casino, and it just came very naturally. People understand those terms -- millions of people gamble. We're not introducing obscure vocabulary to explain our very high-concept, obscure conspiracy."" Fall Preview: Check out all the must-watch new shows But it was also important for Rogers to have some emotional context beneath all the Las Vegas window-dressing. ""Everyone right now feels as if maybe the rules were changed on them,"" Rogers says. ""You sent your kids to college, but somehow your college graduate is living in your basement because he can't get a job. It feels like we're trapped in a game that somebody changed the rules. We said, 'Why don't we externalize that? Why don't we talk about the fact we are trapped in a game, and there's one guy in the middle of it who is on our side?' That gave us the emotional stakes of the show."" Page 2 of 3 - For Alex, his journey is entirely fueled by the heartbreak he feels over the death of his wife. ""Trying to resolve how Ginny died and why she died and who's responsible, is the primary emotional thrust of his investigation,"" Rogers says. ""That's the thing that keeps him going back undercover into this organization."" And continuing to go back in is an issue. After all, the whole concept of a group of people profiting off of crime rather than trying to prevent it is pretty icky, right? ""They're doing a horrible thing,"" Rogers says with a laugh. ""It allows us to have some fun every week, but they're plainly bad guys. Alex is a good guy in the middle of a bad system. One of the essential questions of the show is: Is that system actually the best possible system that we can live with?"" Because of Alex's unease about what he's doing, The Player is unlike most procedurals where the team is one big happy family. Instead, when, in the pilot, Alex threatens to kill Mr. Johnson one day in the not-too-distant future, you're inclined to believe him. However, the team still has to rely on each other, regardless of how much they trust their colleagues. ""Everyone has their own agenda, everyone has their own secret plan, and everyone has their own sort of shifting allegiances,"" Rogers says. ""They are in a life-and-death world, and they have to trust each other as far as they can to not die, but never trust each other enough to make themselves vulnerable."" The Player 's Wesley Snipes and more familiar faces in new places That central conflict will certainly begin to define Mr. Johnson's moral ambiguity, which is exactly what attracted Snipes to the role. ""I get to explore some character work in a way that I probably couldn't in a feature film,"" Snipes says. ""You never know which side he's playing for. You'll learn quickly that Mr. Johnson knows secrets that no one else knows. He's seen a lot of players come and go, and this guy is nothing special at this point. Or so we make it appear. Mr. Johnson has another card that he hasn't played yet. There's a whole deck that Mr. Johnson hasn't played yet."" However, Rogers is quick to caution people from deciding outright that Mr. Johnson is the bad guy. ""There are weeks that Mr. Johnson does something heroic because it fits his sense of personal ethics, and you're like, 'Yeah, I love Mr. Johnson!'"" Rogers says. ""Then, there are days that he's the most horrible human being in the world. I don't know if you ever want to be rooting for him, but you should be fascinated by him. ... His views on power are not necessarily wrong, they're just horrible."" Page 3 of 3 - Then again, Alex isn't an entirely noble hero either. ""He's saving lives. He genuinely enjoys the work, but Alex Kane has a problem. He is a man with a high capacity for violence and a tendency towards it,"" Rogers says. ""To a great degree the two themes for the show are power and addiction. We all have behaviors we're drawn to. We all have those things we can't let go of, be it Ginny's death or the constant fall into violence which comes very easily to him. We all have these desires that are beyond our control, and how we deal with them to a great degree is what defines us."" Although the show is clearly reveling in its procedural makeup (""I love the one-and-done of it,"" Rogers confesses), the writers are telling a longer story. However, the central mystery of Ginny's murder, which gets much more messy by the end of the pilot, won't be stretched out forever. ""The mystery of how that happened, who did it, why it was done -- all of that is meant to be an important thing that we reveal to the audience over the course of the first 12 episodes,"" Rogers says. ""We're not going to hold you over a barrel for five years. Most of the questions in the first season will be resolved by the end of the first season."" The Player premieres Thursday at 10/9c on NBC.

"Words kill or give life; they are usually either poison or good fruit. The words we speak are electromagnetic forces that usually reflect our inner attitude.  
 
They contain the power of death and life and ultimately influence the world around us. Augustus Woodbury once said, “Scientific men tell us that every sound upon the surface of our own and other planets circulates in endless and ceaseless waves through infinite space. Certainly not less subtle is the influence of our words upon the life and character of the world.” We must always think about the influence of our words before we say them out; “what is my objective in saying this.” “Are these words going to produce life or death.” Proverbs 18:21 declares, “Death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruit.” 
 

As a matter of fact, words are our input in someone else’s life. We must make sure our input gives life and not death. We are actually responsible for the impact we have on others and our communities in general. 
 
As responsible citizens, we must intensify our awareness of the input we have on other people’s lives. Actually, one person can change the course of another person’s life with the power of words. Individual dreams and visions have been aborted because of words of death spoken over them. Homes and marriages have been destroyed because of poisonous words. Companies and businesses have fallen because of words of envy and jealousy. People have lost their jobs because of lying words said about them. We should always be conscious of the life-changing power of our words. 
 

Proverbs 19:1 says, “Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool.” We must use wisdom when we speak, by checking our motives, attitudes and choice of words. We must divorce negative patterns of thinking and bring life to others with our words. Words are influencers. One of the best ways we can use words to influence others, is to practice telling the truth. 
 
We are living in the world where too often people try to influence others with manipulation, false flattery and deception and spin doctoring. The truth creates trust, which in turn generates influence. The other way we can put our words to good use, is to choose to use words that build in our speech, rather than words that tear down people and society. 
 

We should use our words to build other people up, to inspire, encourage and empower, to affirm and bless. Positive words yield positive influence. It is wisdom to refuse to speak words that belittle and demoralise other people around us. When we make a choice of speaking well of others, in-spite of their short comings, then we will have a healthy and far reaching positive influence with our words. 
 
If we spread malicious gossip, we are poisoning our own future and sabotaging our own influence with others. King Solomon of ancient Israel said, “When a leader listens to malicious gossip, all the workers get infested with evil” (Proverbs 29:12, the message Bible). We must use the influence of our words to bring peace in conflicting situations. 
 

Due to the fact that many people have no understanding of the power of their words, they have caused themselves and others unnecessary pain and hardships. Each and every day our actions and our words impact those around us. 
 
The question is, how are we influencing others with our words and actions? One of the best ways we can influence each other is by inspiring, motivating and encouraging each other by what we say. The story is told about how Sugar Ray Robinson changed the course of one girl’s life, Flo-Jo. 
 
When narrating her life story Flo-Jo said, “Sugar Ray looked at me in the eye and told me, it doesn’t matter where you come from, what the colour of your skin is, or what odds are against you. All that matters is that you have a dream and you commit yourself to that dream. Do that and it will happen.” She continued and said, “Right then and there, I was sold out. I was just eight years old but I was fired up about what my future could be.” 
 

With words, Sugar Ray Robinson, one of the outstanding boxing champs inspired a great change in one girls’ life. Words are powerful, they can inspire those around us to greatness. They can bring hope to the hopeless, courage to the discouraged, comfort and healing to the oppressed. We must speak life to our husbands, wives, children, fathers, mothers, our communities and nation. 
 
Paul’s wise advice to the Ephesians is appropriate at this juncture, “Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.” (Ephesians 4:29). By our words we can build the nation and by our words we can destroy the nation.",THE INFLUENCE OF OUR WORDS

"JoJo is all grown up and looking incredible in her brand new music video. 

Only ETonline was with the 24-year-old on the set of ""When Love Hurts,"" which marks her first official return to the music biz in almost a decade. After a promising 2004 debut (remember ""Leave (Get Out)""?), and an impressive 2006 follow-up (""Too Little Too Late""), the then-tween found herself involved in a years-long legal battle with her record label. 


FLASHBACK! Also in 2004, 'Mean Girls' Hit Theaters 


""I was kind of in limbo for a long time where I wasn't able to officially release music, there wasn't distribution, and I was just caught in the crossfire of that,"" she told ETonline. ""My fans really stuck by me they started a Free JoJo campaign on social media. It really kept me going and kept me feeling like I could do this and get out on the other side, so with some great lawyering and some perserverence and belief, I am on the other side. [I] signed to Atlantic [Records] early last year, the same day that I signed the release from my previous label, and got right into the studio a couple months later and then have been just working on music ever since."" 

The fruits of her labor: a tringle -- also known as a three-song EP -- released in August, highlighting the now-24-year-old's new sound. 

""I wanted to give a taste of what's the come make an impact in that way while not revealing everything,"" she said.""There is an amazing album to follow, which I'm so proud of."" 

Among the tracks is the club-ready Benny Blanco- and Jason Evigan-produced smash, ""When Love Hurts."" See the full video below.

""I wanted to incorporate the element of vogue [and] there's choreography kind of inspired from different cultures around the world,"" JoJo said. ""There's some Thai, some Indian -- it's really cool and it just feels powerful."" 

While her perspective may have changed with age, she's still singing about her favorite topic. 

""My favorite theme is love, I love to talk about all aspects of it,"" she gushed. ""I am constantly in love, falling into it, out of it, I'm just always in love."" 

[embedded content] 

And it's that experience that puts a new perspective on her old hits, which, for the record, she still loves to perform. 

""I've grown up with them and they take on a new meaning for me,"" she said. ""I was a little girl when I recorded them and now I'm a woman with experiences in love and I'm a little more passionate and emotional, and it's just a nostalgic moment between me and the audience. It's like a big sing-a-long, so I love it.""

You may also remember JoJo from her co-starring roles in Aquamarine (opposite Emma Roberts ) and RV (the late Robin Williams played her dad), though she's remained largely out of the spotlight since then. JoJo tells ET that, with her comeback in full-swing, she ""absolutely"" intends to return to acting. 

""I was in such a strange state mentally,"" she recalled. ""I was so sad about everything, about not being able to release music, so I wasn't really able to focus on acting the way that I want to give it attention. Now that I'm on the other side and I'm in the light, I really want to give myself the shot."" 

JoJo's tringle , titled III , is available now, while a release date for her full-length has not yet been revealed. 

""I wanted to combine live instrumentation with programmed sounds,"" she teased, ""and I think we've come up with something that's really cool.""

"Have you ever felt like trading in the politically correct strictures of the mordern office for the world of Mad Men? Have you ever felt like trading in the politically correct strictures of our modern day office environment for the world of Mad Men? It still exists, apparently, if you are a Melbourne barrister.

That was the gist of a very non-PC marketing campaign by the trouble-prone financial services shop, IOOF.

A male adviser at its subsidiary, Shadforth Financial Group, sent the email soliciting for financial planning business from Melbourne's barrister community.

According to an article in Lawyers Weekly, it had a very specific idea about who our ""typical barrister"" is. Let's just say that the girls and boys have very specific roles.

According to the article, ""After marrying their 'school sweetheart' in their 30s, he suggested barristers in their 40s are likely to find themselves in the following position – 'Your wife is a 'home engineer', managing two children under 10, and you are finding the 'cottage' which was never quite finished is becoming a little crowded'.""

Things are better by the time this archetypal barrister hits his 50s. His career is established and ""your wife has gone back to part-time work and the money flow is good for a while"".

The report said several barristers had complained about this stereotype of a very male Bar with stay-at-home wives.

""Are we not thrust back to the beginnings of Mad Men?"" an anonymous QC told the publication.

A Shadforth​ spokesperson told Lawyers Weekly: ""This does not reflect the view of Shadforth​ and is not the Shadforth​ way.""

It won't be help Shadforth's​ parent, IOOF, which needs all the legal help it can get. The ASX-listed company has faced a Senate grilling, and an investigation from ASIC over allegations of front running, insider trading and faulty research reports. Degree of pain 

CBD would like to admit that we might have been a tad unappreciative of just what the Hawke-Keating era minister, John Dawkins, achieved during his all-too brief stint chairing education dunce, Vocation.

Much has been written about the disastrous unravelling of its business, and carnage for investors who were flogged the stock at more than $3 a pop. It is now worth 10¢.

Good thing they have the luxury of three different class actions at their disposal.

But they should have known better. The risks were all reported in the previous annual report signed by Dawkins, according to his replacement in the chair, Doug Halley.

In this year's report, Halley referred to last year's effort saying: ""Our annual report also referred to risks that might restrict Vocation's ability to deliver on its strategy. With hindsight, two of these risks – the company's dependence on the support of government funding, and damage to its brand – were prescient.""

That is one way of putting it.

There is some good news for investors. The new chief executive, Stewart Cummins, said he plans new initiatives to get the company back on track like, ""build a strong management team"" and upgrade its systems ""to provide accurate management information"".

Wow, why didn't they think of this before the IPO in December 2013.

The most sobering information is that the company paid out a $9.5 million dividend pre IPO, and another $6.5 million in 2014.

That is $16 million in cash dividends for a company now worth $23 million. NAB's Poach 

ASIC's national media manager, Andre Khoury, will be playing on the other side of the fence, taking up a position with NAB next month.

But NAB confirmed that he will not be working with its wealth boss, Andrew Hagger.

It is an important point given Hagger has been moonlighting for ASIC thanks to the bank's wealth fiasco.

In March this year, a Senate committee heard how Hagger has had to check no fewer than five ASIC media releases that had been sent to the bank in draft form.

""Our practice of sending media releases to external entities has been that, with a negotiated outcome – and only with a negotiated outcome such as an Enforceable Undertaking – ASIC will generally provide the party with our media release shortly ahead of publication,"" explained Khoury's current boss, Greg Medcraft​. Fat loss

Singaporean dotcom ""incubator"" Fatfish​ Group came back to the market with a Plan B on Tuesday after its investors gave it a lesson in democracy last week. They unceremoniously dumped its plan to spin-off, and list, mobile phone game maker, iCandy.

Fatfish​ said that, after consulting with iCandy's​ board, the ASX, and its own investors, it remains ""committed to pursuing the proposed spin-off and listing"" of iCandy​.

To avoid another rejection by shareholders at the next meeting, it proposes to retain a larger stake in iCandy​ and distribute fewer shares to its shareholders.

Mind you, its investors might have been reacting to the restatement of Fatfish's accounts last week by its auditors from MSI Ragg Weir.

It appears the backdoor listing of the Fatfish business in July last year, via Atech Holdings, did not meet certain accounting standards.

This means the purchase of one particular Fatfish​ business should have been accounted for as a cost rather than as ""goodwill on acquisition"".

This basically doubled the company's net loss for the year ending December 31, 2014, from $6.5 million to $12.5 million. It reported revenue of $507,310 for that year.

"The Federal Government’s decision to accept 12,000 Syrian refugees into Australia is a start according to the convenor of Amnesty International’s Mudgee branch, Heather Drew. The Federal Government’s decision to accept 12,000 Syrian refugees into Australia is a start according to the convenor of Amnesty International’s Mudgee branch, Heather Drew. Ms Drew said Amnesty was pleased the Australian government has decided to take in some of the millions of Syrian’s unable to return home, especially considering how desperate the situation is getting. 

“It’s a start really,” Ms Drew said.

“The number of Syrian people who are no longer able to return to their own country is in its millions, and all of these people are desperate to make a new home for themselves. 

“We’ve agreed to take 12,000 but the government may need to think about agreeing to take more.”

Ms Drew said while some people had made suggestions that the number was too high, Germany had agreed to house 800,000 refugees that made their way to Europe.

“Twelve thousand people sounds wonderful in comparison to the number Australia agreed to take a year ago, but compared to the total number of people who need help – maybe the government will need to look at the figures again,” Ms Drew said.

Ms Drew said there are around four million Syrian refugees registered with humanitarian groups. 

A large percentage of these people are immigrated to neighbouring countries like Jordan and Lebanon, putting strain on the local economies and resources. 

“There are 7.6 million people who are internally displaced in Syria. People are saying this is the largest humanitarian disaster since the last world war,” Ms Drew said. 

Ms Drew said it was fantastic to see the public becoming involved in the issue, and believed it was a continuing level of public support that pushed the government to agree to help. 

“There’s word that quite a few towns around the country are willing to take rather large numbers of refugees and help them create new lives,” she said. 

“And a lot more people than the government has agreed to take in.”

According to the federal government, women, children, and families from persecuted minorities sheltering in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey will take priority. 

The government will also spend $44 million supplying 240,000 refugees with cash, food, water and blankets in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.

Senior government officials said the first refugees could arrive by Christmas. 

It’s intended that the 12,000 will arrive within the financial year.",Mudgee branch of Amnesty International welcomes decision on Syrian refugees

"Clive Palmer's former friend says he believed the mining billionaire would deliver on a promised $5 million job offer even though the sum wasn't in his contract. 

Bill Schoch is suing Mr Palmer and two Palmer companies for $4.6 million, claiming he was tricked into signing a ""sham"" contract that cut his $5 million salary over five years to a substantially smaller figure. 

Mr Schoch told the Brisbane Supreme Court on Monday that in June 2011 Mr Palmer personally offered him $1 million per year for five years to work for him, but later his contract stated just $100,000 per year. 

Next to the figure Mr Schoch added ""plus bonus as agreed"", which made Mr Palmer's human resources staff laugh. 

""I didn't care whether they laughed or not because it was a deal that I had with Clive, who I'd known for 40 years, and that was it,"" Mr Schoch told the first day of a civil trial.",Palmer's ex-friend seeks 'promised' cash (AAP)

"WASHINGTON, Sept. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Each year, PhRMA and other biopharmaceutical industry leaders honor those who have made a significant contribution to the health care field. The Research and Hope Awards recognize the men and women conducting groundbreaking research, giving back to their community, advocating for patients and bringing awareness to particular diseases. This year, the awards honored those who are changing the world of oncology research and care. As we continue to gain new insight into the many variations of cancer, new tools are created, medicines are developed and new treatments emerge. With the help of dedicated individuals like the 2015 Research and Hope honorees, we move a little bit closer to transforming once-devastating diseases into manageable conditions.

https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150915/266923

This year's recipient of the Excellence in Biopharmaceutical Research award was the KEYTRUDA Team from Merck & Co., Inc. This team developed an approved treatment for advanced melanoma and it has the potential to treat many other types of cancer. We look forward to seeing the continued development of their breakthrough work.

J. Silvio Gutkind, Ph.D., professor, Department of Pharmacology; associate director, Basic Science, Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, is this year's recipient of the award for Excellence in Academic or Governmental Research. His extensive work with G proteins ultimately led to novel strategies for treating and preventing many types of cancer. These advances have the potential to save the lives of many patients in years to come.

The Community Champion Award went to Rick Dunetz, executive director and founder of the Side-Out Foundation. Rick, a local volleyball coach, invited his mother to work with his team after her breast cancer diagnosis. She found hope in their victories and the team was inspired to win not only for themselves, but for her as well. After seeing the transformation of his mother and his team, Rick founded the Side-Out Foundation to reach other athletes and cancer patients. His work is bringing hope and energy to the cause of ending breast cancer.

Vicki Kennedy, co-founder and president of the Board of the ; senior counsel, Greenberg Traurig LLP, was this year's recipient of the Award for Excellence in Advocacy and Activism. Since the passing of her late husband, Senator Ted Kennedy, Mrs. Kennedy has spoken publicly on coping with stress and enhancing quality of life for brain tumor patients and their loved ones. Her dedication to telling her story, and the story of thousands of other families whose lives have been impacted by cancer is inspiring to many.

The recipients of the Visibility and Progress Award are Liz and Jay Scott, co-founders of Alex's Lemonade Stand. In 2000, their four-year-old daughter, Alex, founded Alex's Lemonade Stand to raise money to find a cure for childhood cancer after her own diagnosis. Following Alex's death in 2004, her parents set up the foundation to continue her dream of finding a cure. Since Alex's first stand in 2000, the foundation has raised more than $100 million to fund more than 475 cutting-edge research projects. Alex's spirit of determination and hope lives on through the foundations work.

These five awardees are just a few of the individuals doing outstanding work in the field of oncology research. With their dedication and our continued commitment to finding a cure, the future for cancer patients and their families looks a little bit brighter. To read more about this exciting progress, take a look at some of the honoree's response to the latest Conversations question: What are you most excited about in the fight against cancer?

On behalf of PhRMA and the co-sponsors of the 2015 Research and Hope Awards, we thank you for your contributions to this important effort.

"It is hardly humble, or peaceful, but it is home for Malcolm Turnbull. Inside Malcolm Turnbull's Point Piper pad It is hardly humble, or peaceful, but it is home for Malcolm Turnbull. The new Prime Minister says he will not be moving to Kirribilli House, but is staying put at his red-clay-coloured home in Point Piper, with its own fetching harbour views.

Two days after his swearing in ceremony last Monday, a big yellow crane appeared behind his house for building work at a neighbouring property.

There are at least five major construction and renovation projects underway in the neighbourhood, which comes to life in the early morning hours with the arrival of tradesmen in orange tops and fluorescent green socks tucked inside work boots.

The constant hum of the towering crane that swings large skips full of boulders precariously close to the Turnbull rooftop is punctuated by loud beeping and a cacophony of roaring saws, drills and cement mixers.

Two Australian Federal Police officers sit quietly inside a grey car parked outside the residence. But they have not gone unnoticed by neighbours, who have few complaints about the heightened security presence.

Bernice Belnick welcomed her neighbour's decision to stay.

""I've been boasting I've got a PM in my street,"" she says. ""I'm happy for him to stay.""

Another neighbour who did not wish to be named, said: ""He's got a great house. It's close to the city. Why should he move?""

""I think it's important that they live normally. We often see Lucy [Turnbull] walking the dogs in the morning.""

Further down the road, where white-washed walls are draped in red bougainvillea and black Porche Boxters sit in driveways, Caryl Heilig and Belinda Goldman take time out of their morning walk to share their approval.

""I have no problem with Malcolm staying in the area,"" Ms Goldman said. ""It think that it's great he has chosen to stay in his home. We are very happy that he'll be part of the Eastern Suburbs where we live.""

Ms Heilig agreed it was ""fantastic"" the Turnbulls had decided to stay in the area.

""They may just put a bit more security around the house for him,"" she said.

Jennifer Coyle, who moved from the US to a nearby house two months ago, said she was surprised a Prime Minister would live in the local neighbourhood.

""But we find it very refreshing that he has decided to stay in the local community,"" she said.

The police presence makes her feel a bit safer in the home, ""but it is also a little disconcerting that they are around the corner 24/7"".

Ms Coyle, who works for Macquarie Bank, said she could not imagine an American president living in her street.

""I think they would be so frightened for their security that they would be out of the limelight as much as possible,"" she said.

""It's really nice to see he [Turnbull] is out in the open. We saw him walking in the neighbourhood over the weekend. So it's really good to see he's part of the people.""

Andrew Muston, who has lived in the area for 23 years, said it was clear to him why Mr Turnbull wanted to stay.

""I don't know why he would want to leave. It's a pretty nice set up that he's got.""

Mr Muston, who graduated from the University of Sydney last year with an economics and finance degree, jokes that the decision poses one problem.

""The only issue is we have a couple of house parties, so I was hoping that maybe he might move away and there would be no more noise complaints,"" he said.

""No, he's a good neighbour. I've lived next to him my whole life. He's a good man.""

When in Canberra, Mr Turnbull will live at The Lodge, which has undergone $6.4 million worth of renovations. The work is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

"Santa Barbara County Sheriff's deputies testified Friday that they were aware that a Los Alamos man accused of making threats against his sister owned multiple guns when they went to his house to interview him in March, an incident that turned into an hourslong standoff with the department's special enforcement team. 

Ronald Joseph Carrari, 56, is charged with making criminal threats and resisting arrest stemming from the March 20 incident. His sister, Christina Carrari, had called the Sheriff's Department to report that he had threatened her. 

Four deputies responding to the report went to Ronald Carrari's house south of Los Alamos, where he refused to come out of the house because the deputies did not have a warrant. Two of the responding deputies testified Friday that Ronald Carrari had said he was going to get his guns. 

""I heard him say, 'You got your guns, I'm getting mine,'"" Deputy Jonathan Fleming said. 

However, Fleming and Deputy Bobby Fortier also testified that they had actually seen him holding a gun. A search of his home yielded eight guns, including one that is apparently illegal under California law, a Taurus handgun that fires .410 shotgun shells, making it a short-barreled shotgun. 

At some point during the incident, Ronald Carrari, audibly upset, called 911, expressing fear that deputies were going to kill him and saying that the Sheriff's Department had a ""vendetta"" against him. 

After being arrested under suspicion of making criminal threats and resisting arrest, Ronald Carrari bailed out of jail. He was rearrested after being accused of threatening his sister again several days later. 

The two incidents apparently stemmed from Christina Carrari limiting the hours that her brother could visit their ailing mother, although Ronald Carrari had a history of not getting along with other members of the family, and his father and his developmentally disabled brother had recently obtained restraining orders against him. 

Christina Carrari testified that her brother was allowed to visit their mother between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., which she said were ""her best hours."" 

Other family members were not subject to the visitation hours. Christina Carrari testified that this was due to Ronald Carrari's prior behavior. 

""He was upsetting mom as well as wreaking havoc with all of us,"" she said. 

Their mother died March 18. 

The second incident in which Ronald Carrari is accused of threatening his sister occurred at a memorial service for their mother. Ronald Carrari allegedly placed a memorial planter box with threatening messages written on it outside of the Union Hotel, where the service was being held.  

Testimony will continue Wednesday morning.",Deputies testify in trial of Los Alamos standoff suspect

"Scotland rugby players were greeted with music from school pupils and given tournament caps during their official welcome ceremony at Gloucester Cathedral this afternoon. 
 
The team will be based at Hartpury College for the next few days ahead of the start of their World Cup campaign at Kingsholm Stadium in Gloucester on Wednesday when they face Japan. 
 
The ceremony was a celebration of Scotland Rugby's achievements and included their friends and family as well as members of the local community. 
 
They arrived to a greeting from a choir from Isbourne Valley School performing official tournament anthem `World In Union` in front of an audience including figures from World Rugby, England Rugby 2015 and the Rugby Football Union. 
 
Paul James, leader of Gloucester City Council, presented the team with a special mini Scrumpty as a gift from the city. 
 
He said: ""It is an immense honour to welcome the Scotland Rugby team to the city and a huge privilege for Gloucester to be a host city for the third largest sporting event in the world."" 
 
Following welcome speeches from chairman of England Rugby 2015 Andrew Cosslett and Scotland manager Gavin Scott, each member of the team was presented with a Tournament cap and Rugby World Cup 2015 participation medal. 
 
There were four cap and medal bearers who were selected from local clubs and educational institutions, representing the legacy of Rugby World Cup 2015. 
 
Speaking during the ceremony, Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw who also plays for Gloucester Rugby, said: ""I am so proud to stand here as Scotland captain. It has been months, if not years, of hard work in preparing for this event. 
 
""To all the people of Gloucester it is great to be here. I joined the club just over a year ago and I have really enjoyed getting to know the city. 
 
""I have been explaining to the boys how much you love rugby and they could see it as we drove through the city. But I have one small plea. 
 
""Japan will be playing in cherry and white on Wednesday so for once please could you put that to one side. It would be much appreciated. 
 
""We look forward to seeing you all at Kingsholm on Wednesday."" 
 
The ceremony culminated with a beat-boxing performance by local act Duke. 
 
Gloucester Cathedral is among 17 landmark venues across England and Wales chosen to host Welcome Ceremonies. 
 
It is predicted to be the biggest boost for the UK's travel and tourism industry since the London Olympics three years ago, pumping almost £1billion into the economy during the next month and a half.",City welcomes Scotland before Rugby World Cup kicks off tomorrow
"A Hilo man was scheduled for a preliminary hearing on Thursday to face charges related to the theft of government vehicles and ukulele, according to Big Island police. 
 
On the afternoon of Sept. 9, the State Department of Agriculture reported that a white Dodge Dakota pickup truck had been stolen from state property on Lanikaula Street in Hilo and that the truck had rammed a chain link fence to exit the property. 

Later that evening, 26-year-old Blue Kela of Hilo was observed next to the open driver door of a truck matching the description of the state vehicle. The truck had fraudulent license plates and visible marks that logos had been removed from the front doors. Police confirmed that the truck was the one belonging to the state and arrested Kela on suspicion of first-degree theft. He was taken to the Hilo police cellblock while the Area I Criminal Investigations Section continued the investigation. 

Investigation revealed that Kela was also responsible for stealing two Jeep Cherokees belonging to the County of Hawai'i in August from parking lots on Aupuni Street. 

Investigation also revealed that Kela was responsible for stealing six ukulele from a Downtown Hilo store after damaging a door and breaking into the building on July 31. 

At 4:30 p.m. last Friday, he was charged with first-degree theft, second-degree theft, second-degree burglary, unauthorized entry of a motor vehicle, fraudulent use of license plates, two counts of criminal property damage and two counts of unauthorized control of a propelled vehicle. His bail was set at $53,000. His initial court appearance was Tuesday. 

His preliminary hearing was scheduled for Thursday afternoon in Hilo District Court.","Hilo man, 26, charged with theft of county vehicles, ukulele"

"Residents threw garbage at a United National Congress (UNC) entourage and chased its candidate Raziah Ahmed, former Senate President and acting President of T&T, out of Ramsaran Street, San Fernando yesterday during a walkabout in the marginal constituency of San Fernando West. 
 
Police were called in even though Ahmed said she was in no way threatened by the disgruntled residents.  
 
As a banner of People’s National Movement (PNM) candidate Faris Al-Rawi fluttered in the wind, the residents said they did not want to see any politician at election time because of the “gimmicks.” 
 
Natalie Des Vignes, from Ramsaran Street apartments, who contested the local government elections on an Independent Liberal Party (ILP) ticket last year, said they were unhappy with the UNC. 
 
“We fight in the last elections with Carolyn Seepersad-Bachan and she give us nothing. We don’t even have a Cepep contract here to clean the place. We, the residents, have to chip up every month to raise money to cut the yard,” Des Vignes said. The lawn outside the apartment buildings was littered with beer bottles and other debris. 
 
She added, “We have no work here and we don’t mind getting a few contracts because people here cannot even afford to buy food.” 
 
Another resident, who requested anonymity, said, “We don’t want to see the UNC here. All they doing is passing and waving. What they feel this is a beauty contest? Children hungry here and the only way we will welcome them inside here is if they treat us better.” 
 
A third resident added, “Kamla need to come here to Embacadere and meet with us. Come and check the youths, don’t send anybody else.” 
 
Meanwhile, Vicky Ramlogan, who was part of Ahmed’s entourage said police were called in when the residents started to get unruly. 
 
“They should not get on so because people have a right to vote for whoever they want. This is a democracy,” Ramlogan said.  
 
He added that the residents threw their garbage at the entourage, without any care for the environment. 
 
Ahmed said yesterday that it was the first time that she received such a response during her walkabouts. 
 
“People came out on the road and started to shout. We continued to walk. I didn’t hear what they were saying,” she said. 
 
Asked whether she was getting a negative response from the San Fernando West constituents, Ahmed responded, “The feeling we are getting is that some people clearly supports us and there are others who clearly do not support us. This is the first street where we got that response. We haven’t had this kind of situation before where people are getting on with themselves. I don’t know what their problem is but we are here to bring service to the people.” Police continued patrols in the area up to press time but there were no incidents of violence.",Garbage thrown at Ahmed’s tour
"Alright, alright, alright… the time is now for us to put down our thoughts and predictions about our opening game against the Youngstown State University Penguins .  A lot of newcomers have joined this blog since the end of last season so thanks to you guys for coming onboard and please don’t hesitate to join in. 
 
Onto the main stage event.  As I write this it’s 30 hours to game time and maybe 27 hours or so to meet up with old friends and make new ones while we talk about the present, past and future of the football program and in particular this 2015 team. 
 
We all know about the rather dramatic changes the program and the athletic department have gone through since Dec 17 th when Paul Chryst left for Wisconsin and when our new Beloved Leader, Chancellor Mark Gallagher, dropped the ax on the neck of AD Steve Pederson’s tenure at Pitt. 
 
That has discussed over and overt and now its time to move on to real football! 
 
With that, here is your chance to give the world your Pitt vs. YSU game predictions.  Please add your thoughts on why you feel your prediction will come true and, if you feel like it, throw in some individual player’s work that you think will make it happen. 
 
I’m asking for your thoughts so I’ll start off with mine… 
 

 
In my 2015 season prediction article  I wrote about the reasons I have some trepidation regarding our new Head Coach Pat Narduzzi’s debut and how it will affect the players’ on field play and the coaching staff’s in-game coaching in determining the outcome of the match.  I’m not 100% sold that Narduzzi is going to be able to go head to head this early in his career with a good, successful and well established YSU Head Coach Bo Pelini and win the game in a fashion most Pitt fans have been assuming will happen… which would be a blow-out Pitt win. 
 
That may not be a concern for me after the Iowa game, especially if we do well in those  two games.  But right now there has to be a lot of wondering in the clubhouse and the coaches’ offices as to what product we’ll put out on the field of play. 
 
That said, we have talented football players, some extremely so, on offense, who should be able to play through any worries they themselves may have and through any poor in-game decisions by the staff (and there will be a few).  If our incumbent QB takes the reins right out of the gate and shows true leadership of the offense then I’ll feel better about the outcome. 
 
However, as our commenter “Still the One” pointed out in his comments Wednesday; Narduzzi and Chaney are looking for a good performance from transfer QB Nate Peterman early on in the game.  I don’t believe it will be a ‘ wait until we are a huge lead ahead or big deficit  behind to play the backup QB ’  situation but that the staff has real need for them to see Peterman playing actual football against an opponent.  We’ll discuss the outcome of that move on Sunday I’m sure. 
 
However, just the offense picking up where it left off, and actually I don’t think it will especially with the jerry-rigged  offensive line and the uncertainty at WR, doesn’t guarantee us a win.  The defense has to be there in even better form than the offense to get a win. I believe our defense is still in a state of instability and is going to be changing on the fly during this game and week to week for a few games.  As I’ve said before I think Narduzzi and Conklin’s plan for single coverage by the cornerbacks is a problem waiting to show its face, at least in this first game. 
 
Here is what I think after reading, writing and digesting all the Pitt footballs news, notes and opinions since Pat Narduzzi signed on the dotted line: 
 
Reed’s Take: 
  The game will close through three quarters with both teams leading at one point.  Conner gets less than 100 yards but scores two TDs.  Passing game will be OK with more use of our TEs and Peterman will impress in his playing time.  We create turnovers by aggressive defensive play but give up more passing (at least one big pass play) and rushing yards than we hoped we would.  Pitt pulls away in the 4th quarter to win…   
Pitt 27 – YSU 20   
 
Chip in with your thoughts as to what you think we’ll see and what the outcome will be.  We’ll take a look at our predictions on Sunday and talk about the outcome of this important game. 
 
NOTE :  We didn’t get many responses for suggestions on a meeting place for the pre-game Pitt Blather meeting.drink/bull throwing festivities.  So I’m asking you guys to meet at the Bettis Grill before the game.  I’ll be there at around 11:30. I’ll try to get there earlier but have a friend’s tailgate in Red 7 to visit also – he owes me $40 so I have to break his kneecap.  After that I’ll go over to Bettis’ and then leave around 12:30 or so for the press box. 
 
I can’t wait to see old friends and meet some new Blather followers.  Again, check the picture out on this post… I’ll be the guy with his head above almost everyone else’s, a blue polo shirt with “Blather” on it and longer hair and a DW style mustache.",2015’s Opening Game Predictions

"Two Jersey City men armed with a handgun were arrested Wednesday afternoon and charged with a brazen daylight attack at a car wash, Jersey City spokeswoman Jennifer Morrill said. 
 
Jersey City Police responding to the report of an aggravated assault at a car wash on Broadway at around noon quickly identified and arrested the two men, and also recovered a loaded handgun and drugs, Morrill said. 
 
Johnny Rojas, 33, of Romaine Avenue, was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, terroristic threats, possession of a handgun, and numerous narcotics charges, including possession and possession with intent to distribute. 
 
Alexis Diaz, 33, of Duncan Avenue, was charged with possession of a handgun, terroristic threats, and numerous narcotics charges, including possession and possession with intent to distribute. 
 
The victim, a 26-year-old Griffith Street resident, told police two men approached him while he was washing a black SUV and asked him the whereabouts of his cousin, whom they claimed owed them money, Morrill said. 
 
Rojas and Diaz then attempted to punch the man, with Rojas lifting his shirt and showing a black handgun to the victim. The Griffith Street man then fled to the entrance of the business and called police, Morrill said. 
 
The man provided a description of his attackers to a police dispatcher, as well as the white Infiniti they fled the scene in. Plainclothes officers in the Street Crimes Unit who were working in the area, as well as West District patrol, responded to the Romaine Avenue address to which the vehicle was registered, Morrill. 
 
Police saw the vehicle parked at the home and eventually spotted Rojas and a third individual, Hector Poll-Ortiz, walking on Broadway. When officers approached the two men, they saw the handle of a handgun sticking out of Rojas' waistband, Morrill said. 
 
When one officer yelled ""gun,"" Rojas attempted to turn around and flee but was forced to the ground. A loaded, black Remington semi-automatic handgun was recovered from Rojas, who was also in possession of $468 in cash and the keys to the Infiniti, the spokeswoman said. 
 
Meanwhile, Diaz was spotted walking nearby with cuts on his hand. Due to the proximity of the crime location and the apprehension of Rojas, officers detained Diaz, who was later identified as the second attacker from the car wash. 
 
While the car was being impounded, officers found six bags of suspected CDS cocaine in the cup holder in the middle console, Morrill said. 
 
Poll-Ortiz, who was not charged in connection with the car wash attack, was arrested on an open Hudson County Sheriff's Office warrant and was turned over to that agency for processing, Morrill added.",Cops quickly nab 2 men in Jersey City car wash attack
"The Texas State football team scored 63 points in its home opener. Here's the five key plays from the win. 
 
1. A new school record 
 
Prairie View A&M was trailing 27-3 with a couple seconds remaining in the first quarter, facing a 3rd-and-15 on Texas State’s 43 yard-line. The Panthers punted in order to pin the Bobcats in their own territory, but their plan was foiled by Brandon McDowell, sophomore cornerback. 
 
McDowell fielded the punt and found some space to make a play. The sophomore ran past a couple of Panthers and all of a sudden a lane opened up for him. McDowell broke some tackles, and ankles, and took the punt across the field for a 95-yard punt return for a touchdown. McDowell is behind Brandon Smith, senior wide receiver, for punt returns, but after a return like this, Smith might be looking over his shoulder. 
 
2. Second chance 
 
It took 88 seconds for Texas State to get on the board. Another touchdown followed less than two minutes later. The opportunity was created because Damani Alexcee, junior safety, forced a fumble that Trey McGowan, senior linebacker, recovered at Texas State’s 39-yard line. The fumble recovery opened up the game entirely by gifting another possession to the Bobcats. 
 
3. Back on track 
 
Robert Lowe, senior running back, scored the first touchdown of the game with 13:32 remaining in the first quarter. The touchdown was set up by a 49-yard completion to Jafus Gains, senior wide receiver, that put the team on the five-yard line. This drive set the tone for the rest of the game as Texas State showed their dominance all night over Prairie View A&M. Lowe rushed to the left side with ease and gave Texas State a 7-0 lead. 
 
4. Bowling ball 
 
On third 3rd-and-3 in the redzone, Texas State went to Chris Nutall, senior running back. Nutall did enough to get the first down but he found more running room and took his carry into the end zone for six points. Nutall’s score gave Texas State a 14-0 lead with 9:54 left in the first quarter. All hopes of an upset for Prairie View A&M were diminishing after the score. The drive was the Bobcats’ second of the game and their high powered offense was on display early on in the game. 
 
5. Going long 
 
The play started off looking like an option play with Tyler Jones, junior quarterback, but he pulled back from the option. Smith was wide-open in the secondary. The senior wide receiver hauled in the pass from Jones and the Panthers secondary was nowhere in sight. Smith took the catch for a 65-yard touchdown. The touchdown gave the team a 20-0 lead in the game. It was the first of three passing touchdowns for Jones.",Five key plays from Texas State's home opener
"An inmate at a maximum-security prison has been kept in segregation for two-and-a-half years, according to a report. 
 
		 
The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) for HMP Whitemoor revealed that it detained seven of the 24 prisoners held in segregation for more than six months across England's high-security jails as of June 1 this year. 
  Whitemoor prison near March, Cambridgeshire   
Inspectors said a staffing ""merry-go-round"" meant inexperienced staff were needed to work on the segregation unit and management was ""poor"". 

			 
Prison rules enable a governor to arrange for a prisoner to be segregated - kept away from other inmates - for up to 72 hours before seeking authorisation from the secretary of state. Inmates can be segregated if they are deemed to be in danger, to prevent danger to other prisoners or as punishment for disruptive behaviour. 



 
The IMB cited a United Nations protocol which defines solitary confinement for more than 22 hours a day as torture and said m any inmates in segregation at the Cambridgeshire jail were often confined for longer. 

The report, covering the year to May 2015, said: ""Although often faced with challenging prisoners, requiring officers to get into and  out of personal protection equipment, on most days staff were able to offer a full  regime. 

""It was not however unusual for some curtailment to be necessary,  meaning that residents might miss showers, corporate worship, phone calls and  exercise. At its worst, for example on 10 occasions in April, the Seg (segregation unit) had to be  locked down."" 

The regime in place was ""much the same"" as that which HM Inspectorate of Prisons found in 2011 to be ""inadequate"", inspectors added. 

			 
""One of the other problems noted by Inspectors was the poor management  arrangements for the Seg. Whilst there have been definite improvements, with  greater adherence to procedures and standards, and consistency of decision-making,  new prison-wide staffing arrangements meant that the custody manager  responsible for the Seg was more frequently away from the unit, for example  acting as orderly officer, managing detail or on nights,"" the report said. 

"" We do not blame  Whitemoor managers for this merry go-round, which results from centrally-imposed  staffing norms."" 

A high-profile terrorist prisoner recently won a legal challenge at the UK's highest court against his segregation at HMP Whitemoor. 

Kamel Bourgass, an Algerian who is serving 17 years for conspiracy to commit public nuisance by using poisons or explosives in relation to the 2002 Ricin terrorist plot, was segregated for extended periods. 

			 
The Supreme Court ruled in July his confinement, for periods or more than a month, was unlawful beyond the initial 72-hour period.

"Just what Sherlock needed after his relapse: to come face-to-face with his daddy issues. When  Elementary  returns this fall, Sherlock ( Jonny Lee Miller ) will be dealing with the aftermath of his relapse in last season's finale. One of the consequences? His father Morland Holmes, played by John Noble , is coming to New York to check up on his son. Morland is an international consultant who has a lot of power and has amassed a considerable fortune. ""He's someone who works from the shadows to help various governments and mega-corps and titans of industry make moves around the globe,"" creator Rob Doherty tells TVGuide.com. ""He has the ear of many important and wealthy and influential people. He has a personality that's very appropriate to that kind of work and those kinds of worlds: He's very stern, very calculating, extremely bright -- but that's probably not a big surprise. Like Sherlock, he's typically a few moves ahead of the people he works with and then [is] able to predict certain behaviors."" Check out all this week's Mega Buzz! Whether or not the elder Holmes will try to apply those skills to his son remains to be seen, but Morland will stick his nose into Sherlock's first case back, which is loosely inspired by the canonical story, ""The Adventure of Wysteria Lodge."" Guest star Patrick Page, whom we met in last season's finale, will reprise the role of Jonathan Bloom, a man with an unsavory history of preying on desperate women who then disappear. This time, however, Bloom will seek out Sherlock for help. ""Bloom insists that he is not responsible for the disappearance of at least one of the women,"" Doherty says. ""His wife vanished without a trace five years ago. He's always insisted that he's innocent. He's been in the tabloids quite a bit. So, he approaches Sherlock, engages him and wants Sherlock Holmes to prove that he's innocent of his wife's disappearance.""

Then, the politicians … send the US military to invade, bomb, and KILL HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of people, the vast majority of whom are innocent people. … ANIMOSITY against the United States is GROWING EXPONENTIALLY; in an effort to keep our country at war, our ECONOMY is being overburdened and overtaxed TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN; in the name of the “War on Terror,” America is on the verge of becoming a giant POLICE STATE; we are INCITING CHINA AND RUSSIA INTO NUCLEAR WAR; and America’s military VETERANS are KILLING THEMSELVES more frequently than are enemy bullets”

ST. LOUIS , Sept. 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Attorneys from the Houston and Kansas City offices of the Potts Law Firm, LLP , have filed a new lawsuit against auto manufacturing giant General Motors LLC (NYSE: GM) in St. Louis City Circuit Court on behalf of 90 individual victims of a deadly ignition switch defect that led to the recall of more than 28 million GM vehicles worldwide and has caused more than 120 deaths and thousands of injuries. 

The new claims for serious injuries and wrongful death follow this week's announcement that GM will pay a $900 million criminal settlement as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with U.S. Department of Justice for misleading the government and the public about the company's handling of the faulty ignition switches. 

The Potts Law Firm represents hundreds of individuals and their families in lawsuits against GM in Missouri courts and other jurisdictions across the U.S. The new claims filed in St. Louis allege that the GM ignition switches caused vehicles to shut off while being driven, prevented protective airbags from inflating, and caused seatbelts to malfunction. The new filing is Patricia Foreman , et al. v. General Motors LLC . Overall, the firm represents nearly 150 ignition switch victims in St. Louis . 

Accomplished trial attorney and Potts Law Firm Managing Partner Derek Potts represents the families of Tabatha Rogers , 26, and Tara Yates , 27, who died in 2014 when their car unexpectedly careened off a level stretch of highway. Their case is tentatively set for trial in January 2016 in St. Louis . 

Ms. Rogers lost control of her 2001 Pontiac Grand Am on the day after Valentine's Day on old State Highway 35 in Sevier County, Tennessee . The car hit an embankment before becoming airborne and striking a utility pole. Ms. Rogers died at the scene and Ms. Yates died shortly after at a nearby hospital. Mr. Potts says he plans to prove that a faulty GM ignition switch caused the fatal crash. 

""We believe the evidence clearly shows that these young women would still be here today if not for an ignition switch that General Motors knew was defective,"" says Mr. Potts. ""It is extremely telling that airbags in their car didn't inflate at any point despite this violent, fatal wreck."" 

The Houston -based Potts Law Firm represents clients in a variety of personal injury claims and mass tort matters, from complex pharmaceutical cases to automobile defect cases to product liability claims. The firm currently is accepting new GM ignition switch cases and referrals. Visit www.potts-law.com   for more information.

"The Asus MG279Q is one of two models in this roundup - the other is the Acer XB270HU - to use in-plane switching (IPS) technology. The other monitors use twisted nematic (TN) panels, which have inferior viewing angles.

Hence, if viewing angles are your biggest concern, you should be looking at these two models.

The Acer and the Asus differ mainly in the variable refresh rate technology used. Asus supports AMD FreeSync, while Acer uses Nvidia's G-Sync technology. The variable refresh rate range on the Asus is between 35Hz and 90Hz. This is not as wide as the Acer (30Hz to 144Hz) and the BenQ XL2730Z (40Hz to 144Hz). However, it is probably adequate as most games should be running at frame rates within this range. If your games fall outside this range, you can probably tweak their graphics settings to bring them back within the range to benefit from FreeSync.

Physically, the monitor is fairly slim, with a 13mm-wide bezel.

Overall, my impression is that the monitor is not overly loud and should appeal to non-gamers too.

You can pivot the Asus 90 degrees for a portrait orientation or swivel it by up to 60 degrees to its sides. It has a pair of built-in speakers and two USB 3.0 ports at the bottom rear of the display.

Navigate the on-screen display (OSD) settings with a joystick. The monitor includes six predefined settings, or profiles, that are optimised for different usage modes, from watching movies to playing a first-person shooter game.

A demo feature helps you decide whether the selected profile is suitable. It splits the screen into two, with one half showing the original display setting and the other the chosen profile, so that you can see both side by side. A crosshair overlay can be turned on to help gamers aim in shooting games.

Screen brightness topped out at 270 nits, making it one of the brightest models I have tested. However, colour accuracy was average with a score of 3 out of 5 compared to 4.5 for the Acer. Several handy features for gamers

Gamers will like this BenQ XL2730Z monitor. Not only does it support AMD FreeSync for a smooth gaming experience (with a compatible AMD graphics card), but also it has a number of features that cater to gamers.

For example, you can hang your headset on a retractable hook at the left of the display. A carry handle makes it easier to take the monitor to LAN gaming parties.

You can plug your headset into the monitor, as it has headphone and microphone jacks. On-screen display (OSD) settings let gamers adjust the headset volume or mute the headset microphone.

The BenQ's screen can pivot 90 degrees to a portrait orientation. It lets you swivel 45 degrees to the sides - more limited than other monitors I've tried. The monitor comes with a unique feature that I find useful. The OSD settings can be adjusted using an external controller dubbed the S Switch. The wired round puck, which comes with large buttons and a scroll wheel, fits neatly into a circular indent at the base of the monitor stand.

I find the S Switch easier to use than traditional OSD buttons on other monitors. You can also save up to three different sets of display settings, and switch quickly between them using the S Switch.

Gaming-centric features include a Black Equalizer mode, which attempts to brighten dark areas of the screen so that you can spot concealed enemies more easily during a game. There is also a motion-blur reduction feature that helps reduce the amount of smearing during fast action games.

But both features have their downsides. The Black Equalizer mode makes everything look overexposed and affects colour accuracy. Turning on blur reduction leads to a reduction in screen brightness. So use them with discretion.

The AMD FreeSync feature on this BenQ monitor works for refresh rates from 40Hz to 144Hz - the widest range among the three AMD FreeSync monitors in this round-up. Its closest rival is the Asus MG279Q, which has a FreeSync range of 35Hz to 90Hz.

The viewing angle is decent, but not as wide as on monitors that use in-plane switching display technology. Nevertheless, the BenQ's twisted nematic screen has good colour accuracy - as long as you do not use its Black Equalizer mode. Lower screen resolution is a letdown

The biggest flaw in this Philips monitor is its 1,920 x 1,080-pixel screen resolution. While this resolution is adequate for a 24-inch monitor, it is not good enough for a 27-inch display. In comparison, the other monitors in this roundup have screen resolutions of at least 2,560 x 1,440 pixels.

To be fair, the lower screen resolution may be useful for gamers with less powerful computers. They can run games smoothly at the native resolution without having to reduce their graphics settings. On the other hand, the Philips monitor does not look as sharp as its rivals when it comes to browsing the Internet or reading a document.

Viewing from the sides and the bottom is poor, though not unexpected, given that this monitor uses a twisted nematic (TN) panel instead of in-plane switching (IPS) technology. There is one upside though: TN screens usually have low response time and input lag. As a result, games, especially first-person shooters, feel responsive.

Philips has tried to inject a bit of flair into the design. The display has a red strip in front and its stand has an opening for cables to pass through. You can rotate the screen by 90 degrees to portrait orientation, and swivel the display to the right or left by 65 degrees.

However, the bezel looks chunky at around 25mm at the top and 20mm at the sides. A laptop-style external power brick is required. Like most Nvidia G-Sync monitors, the Philips monitor has a single DisplayPort connector. There are no HDMI or DVI inputs. But there is an integrated USB hub with four USB 3.0 ports at the back.

Touch-sensitive buttons operate the on-screen display settings. The settings are fairly basic with no profiles for specific tasks.

There is an option to display a crosshair on the screen to help players in first-person shooter games. But this lone gamer feature feels like a token gesture.

In my test with a colourimeter, the Philips covered 99 per cent of the sRGB colour space. Colour accuracy was decent, but not as good as some of its competitors.

At $999, the Philips is one of the least expensive Nvidia G-Sync monitors in the market, though AMD FreeSync models are around the same price.

However, the IPS-based Acer XB270HU arguably provides better value despite being more expensive at $1,099. Friendly price tag but there's a catch

Of the five monitors in this round-up, Samsung U28E590DS is the only model with an ultra high-definition (also known as 4K) resolution. Its rivals have a screen resolution of 2,560 x 1,440 pixels or fewer.

Yet, it is one of the more affordable monitors at $899. Only the BenQ XL2730Z is cheaper ($888).

But there is a catch. The Samsung monitor uses a twisted nematic (TN) panel with viewing angles that are not as wide as other displays based on in-plane switching (IPS) technology. The bottom viewing angle is especially bad, with significant colour shift.

Samsung has tried to remedy this inherent weakness in TN displays with an image enhancement feature dubbed Samsung Magic Angle. This feature offers five different profiles, each designed to alleviate the poor viewing angles of the display for specific scenarios. For instance, Group View is intended for multiple viewers while Lean Back tries to improve the viewing experience when looking at the display from below.

In practice, Magic Angle works pretty well - so much so that I could almost forget that this is a monitor with a TN display.

The Samsung scored well in our colour accuracy test. I also like that it comes with a joystick for users to adjust the on-screen display settings. It is easier to use than the usual buttons.

However, you will need a high-end gaming system to get the most out of this monitor. Unlike its rivals, the Samsung has a very limited FreeSync range (40 to 60Hz). This means that unless your game is running between 40 and 60 frames per second, it will not benefit from FreeSync. To achieve such consistent frame rates in the latest games at 3,840 x 2,160 pixels requires a powerful computer, such as one with dual graphics cards.

It is not a deal-breaker if you have a high-end system, but keep this in mind if you are buying the monitor solely for the FreeSync feature. Other flaws that may put you off: The monitor lacks pivot and swivel functionality and it also has no USB ports.",IPS gaming monitor has great viewing angles

"""It will always be somewhere that reminds her of what Lachlan did,"" says the actress 
        
A torn Alicia Metcalfe is to decide that her future lies in Portugal - and away from husband David, who opts to stay in Emmerdale. 
 
Alicia, whose memories of the village are tainted by her assault earlier this year at the hands of Lachlan White, will depart in emotional scenes to be shown next week. 
 
""There's a moment where Alicia says that she feels like a failure because she was once happy in Emmerdale and she's now let Lachlan beat her,"" says actress Natalie Anderson. ""She's disappointed in herself for not being stronger and I'm sad for her too. It was a place she loved very much, but at the moment it will always be somewhere that reminds her of what Lachlan did. But, down the line, who knows what might happen?"" 
 
So is there not even a small part of her that wants to stay? ""No, absolutely not. She misses her sister, but not everything else. They're also dealing with Val's death, which is bleak and upsetting, especially for Jacob. So it's become a dark place for her, whereas Portugal is lovely and sunny. Over there, she felt like she had a future again."" 
 
David has, of course, been preoccupied with looking out for his grieving dad Eric's welfare. But viewers - and Alicia - know that he would in fact do anything to stay in the village and not return overseas. And, in the end, it's only when David's mask slips that the whole truth comes out. 
 
""Alicia loves David deeply, but she's becoming frustrated with him because she wants him to have the courage to say that he never wanted to go to Portugal and doesn't want to go back,"" continues Anderson. ""She feels like he's using his dad as an excuse. She would have more respect for him if he just came out and said it. Then when he does, that stresses her out a lot."" 
       
As for Anderson, the storyline marks the end of her five years on the ITV soap. ""The fans have been so kind,"" she says. ""I've had lots of messages saying that they can't believe I'm leaving. Prior to the helicopter crash, there was a lot of speculation that Alicia would die. I've been overwhelmed by the support that the fans have shown both me and my on-screen family."" 
 
And who is she going to miss the most? ""Everyone! Obviously my girls - Roxy Shahidi, Fiona Wade and Gaynor Faye. I'll miss them deeply. But obviously my family as well. I'll miss them all.""

"The borrowing party is about to end for smaller and more debt-laden oil producers, WSJ reports, with drillers bracing for cuts to their credit lines next month as banks re-evaluate how much energy companies’ oil and gas properties are worth and the low price of oil catches up to the producers.  Some smaller companies already are negotiating with their lenders, dumping assets at low prices and delaying payments to vendors.  ""With eight bankruptcies already announced this year, weaker producers could live or die by the whims of capital providers,"" and banks will reduce borrowing bases by as much as 15%, according to Citi analysts, which WSJ says would dry up ~$10B of liquidity.  More distress likely is in store for many companies because the hedges they purchased as protection against low oil prices are increasingly expiring.

"ISLAMABAD: The Presidency clarified on Wednesday that President Mamnoon Hussain had no intention to lead the PML-N campaign for local government elections in Sindh. 

“President Mamnoon Hussain, as a symbol of the federation, is above politics and has no political motives,” the president’s spokesman said, rejecting the PPP’s objection to his participation in a PML-N meeting despite a ban on his taking part in political activities by the court. 

According to a press release issued by the PM Office on Monday, Prime Minister Sharif and President Hussain co-chaired a meeting of the PML-N Sindh office-bearers held at the Prime Minister’s House. 

The party’s Sindh general secretary briefed the president and the prime minister on the district committees set up in all 29 districts of the province to launch mass contact campaigns, it said. 

The PPP, whose Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari had been criticised for holding dual offices and convening meetings of the party at the Presidency, said it wondered how President Hussain could chair a political meeting of the ruling party. 

“The PPP is surprised that unlike former president Asif Zardari, the incumbent president is no longer restrained by the court order from participating in partisan political meetings,” PPP’s spokesman Farhatullah Babar said in a statement on Tuesday. 

But the president’s spokesman said: “There is no truth in the reports that the president will lead the PML-N campaign for the local bodies’ elections in Sindh.” 

The spokesman said in statement that in the past President Hussain had for long been active in politics in Sindh and had wide connections with the provincial leadership and workers due to which a large number of political workers remained desirous of meeting him in their individual capacity. 

“Recently, when office-bearers of Sindh PML-N came to Islamabad they expressed their desire to meet the president on a personal and social basis upon which Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif personally requested the president to informally visit the PM House and meet his former colleagues,” the spokesman said. 

“There were no political motives of the president behind that meeting,” he added. 

The Lahore High Court had on May 12, 2011, ruled that (then) President Asif Zardari should relinquish the post of PPP co-chairman and the Presidency should not be used for political activities. 

“The use of Presidency for political activity is inconsistent with its sanctity, dignity, neutrality and independence. Therefore, it is expected that the president of Pakistan would cease the use of the premises of Presidency for political meetings of his party,” the four-judge bench of the LHC had said in its order on a petition filed by senior lawyer A.K. Dogar on behalf of the Pakistan Lawyers Forum challenging the holding of political office by Mr Zardari.

"Factional unanimity in the ALP could facilitate any move to dump Bill Shorten as leader. Source: AAP Australians woke to a new Prime Minister on Tuesday morning and feedback from opinion pollsters has been coming in thick and fast. The new incumbent, Malcolm Turnbull, is preferred by up to 70 per cent of voters according to the Morgan Poll and by a staggering 94 per cent of Coalition voters according to ReachTEL.

Turnbull is opposed by a somewhat stressed Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who is supported as alternative prime minister by only 24 per cent of voters, according to Morgan, with more than a quarter of ALP voters preferring Turnbull as PM.

No wonder Shorten wants to meet Turnbull to discuss the China free-trade agreement — he’s probably after a joint shot for his campaign brochure.

Even more tellingly, ReachTEL shows a clear majority of Greens voters — the ones supposed to deliver 90 per cent of their prefer­ences to Labor — support Turnbull over Shorten.

This majority support for Turnbull from Greens voters came in a poll held after Turnbull was politically mugged on the way to Yarralumla and forced to hand control of waterways to the Nationals, a move that will cost votes for Nationals candidates at the next election, leading to more of their state and federal seats progressively being knocked off by challenges from Labor, the Greens and independents.

ReachTEL also estimates that the election of Turnbull as PM means the swing in Western Australia’s Canning by-election today should be about minus 5 per cent, instead of the 10 per cent predicted by all polls before the leadership spill.

A week ago, an upset Labor win in Canning was possible and this result would have been consistent with the seat’s former position as an ALP marginal during the Hawke and Keating years.

A 5 per cent swing against the Coalition would equal the personal support attracted by Canning’s former Liberal MP, the late Don Randall, suggesting the Liberals effectively retained all of their party vote.

That in turn would imply the Howard battlers are firmly in the grip of the Coalition 12 months out from the next election, in Canning and comparable seats across the country, such as Lindsay in NSW or Longman in Queensland.

This conclusion is confirmed by a ReachTEL national poll showing a two-party preferred vote of 50 per cent for the Turnbull-led Coalition, with a Galaxy poll showing 51 per cent. This is an increase of 4 per cent to 5 per cent over the figures under Tony Abbott, and I suspect the Coalition’s standing will improve ­further, given the former prime minister’s net dissatisfaction scores and the likely positive scores for Turnbull.

A rough guide to the impact of Abbott on his party vote can be obtained by dividing his net dissatisfaction scores by about five, and this corresponds to an interim sugar hit to the Coalition vote of about 6 per cent.

How long the hit lasts depends to some extent on how quickly disaffected conservatives in the Coalition stop sabotaging the new PM before he has had a chance to save their seats from their own poor judgment. It would help if Turnbull’s backers stopped provoking Abbott loyalists by boasting about their hatchet job on the ousted PM as this is a story that appeals to political insiders but not to voters.

Cheering on yesterday’s men among the conservatives is yesterday’s man for the ALP, Shorten, who less than a week ago was cruising to a certain victory for Labor with about 54 per cent of the two-party preferred despite net satisfaction ratings almost as bad as those of Abbott.

Complacency on the part of Labor and the timidity of its leadership left the party reliant on the visceral dislike of Abbott among key groups to insulate Labor from the Greens in the ALP’s inner-city seats and to make gains in marginal urban seats, especially in Victoria and South Australia.

This strategy became redundant within 24 hours of Abbott’s demise as many of the middle-class and professional voters Shorten thought were in the bag switched their support to the new Turnbull government. Now Shorten is Turnbull’s greatest asset and the Prime Minister should do everything he can to ensure the Opposition Leader survives until the next election.

My profiles of elections back to 1966 make it clear that Labor gains broad-based community support when it develops credible economic and social policies for working families in provincial cities and outer suburbs, and for middle-class families in marginal urban seats. Labor has been able to build on this foundation and go on to win elections when it has chosen leaders capable of articulating these policies during an extended period of opposition and making them relevant to key groups in marginal seats.

Shorten’s insipid leadership means Labor has done neither — and now it may be too late.

The party’s first problem is the rules put in place by Kevin Rudd to protect the leader from caucus challenges. If Shorten’s net satisfaction scores don’t improve and the ALP’s vote begins to decline towards 45 per cent, Labor will be looking to dump him as quickly and as quietly as possible. But the rule changes make it potentially harder — unless there’s a complete agreement across all the factions to ignore the rules, in effect, and let the caucus get on with it.

This means a challenge could become a protracted and public fight, which would hurt Labor’s vote even further. If the factions agreed Shorten had to go, his replacement would be difficult to find as the factional gene pool in the ALP is so shallow, there are no natural leaders who seem capable of dominating Turnbull in parliamentary or public debates.

Even with a competent leader, Labor and the union movement have a long-running problem in rebuilding the support base they once had among skilled blue-collar men in Labor’s safer urban seats and in outer urban marginals such as Canning.

To become PM you need to be able to control a majority of seats on the floor of the House of Representatives, and it helps to win more than 50 per cent of the vote, but you don’t need it if you can win more than 50 per cent of the votes in more than half the seats.

If you win the votes in the right seats the swing pendulum also becomes meaningless because it’s ­really only a retrospective device to measure what happened and does not predict what can happen.

In 1998, the ALP needed a two-party preferred swing of about 4 per cent to win a majority of seats on the pendulum and it actually managed a swing of 5.1 per cent, yet that left it still needing a swing of 0.8 per cent to win. This is because winning votes in your opponents’ key seats reshuffles the seats along the pendulum even if the swing doesn’t change.

John Howard achieved this in 1998 by winning support from traditional Labor-voting welfare recipients and skilled blue-collar tradies in seats such as Canning.

Profiling of elections back to 1966 shows that the Labor vote from tradies trended downwards from 1980 and split about 50-50 between Labor and the Coalition in 2004. The tradies profile for Labor bounced back a little in 2007 and 2010, but once more split 50-50 in 2013.

Should that remain the case next year, the Coalition is likely to continue to maintain a lead of about 6 per cent among men.

The decline in support for the ALP among blue-collar men during the 1980s and 90s was counterbalanced by an increase in the ALP vote among women.

The female ALP vote rose in proportion to the increase in women’s workforce participation rates, which went up from 34 per cent in 1961 to 53 per cent in 1993.

The two-party preferred ALP vote among women pulled ahead of the equivalent figure for men in the early 80s, with many crossing to Labor via the Australian Democrats. The ALP’s primary vote from women is now consistently about six points ahead of its primary vote from men. Politically this means that, since 2001, you would be likelier to find a safe Labor seat dominated by female clerks than by male tradies, and you would be just as likely to find a Labor seat dominated by female professionals as male tradies.

This increased participation in the workforce by clerical and professional women has had a big pay-off for unions. Just as Labor’s power base became more feminised and shifted its centre of gravity from traditional outer urban seats to move closer to the goat cheese circle, so too did the power base for the union movement.

While the proportion of male union members in the private sector continues to decline, the proportion of female union members in the public sector has remained steady, although it temporarily rose in tandem with Rudd and Wayne Swan’s stimulus in 2009.

Public sector jobs in administration, education and health are keeping the union movement afloat, and these three industries in both sectors now account for 52 per cent of all union members.

These workers have been easily persuaded by their union officials to support quotas for union members in hospitals and schools, and this focus on membership growth rather than outcomes for patients and students requires a lot of public spending and commensurately higher taxes, which of course hit private sector blue-collar jobs for blokes.

This is why Labor was incapable of cutting public spending under Rudd and Julia Gillard, and why the ACTU has been desperate to secure the election of another big-spending Labor government under a weak leader who considers themselves to be dependent on union support.

The evidence, however, shows that although more than half of the extra million jobs created by Labor were in public administration, education and health, there was no political return for Rudd in 2013 in terms of bigger swings to Labor from electorates containing larger numbers of voters working in these industries.

Labor’s lead among female voters comes from the seats domin­ated by the 50 per cent of employed women in full-time jobs. They voted Labor in 2013 and swung to Labor, irrespective of their industry or union membership. The other 50 per cent of working women in the more vulnerable part-time jobs live in the aspirational middle-class seats that voted strongly for the Coalition and swung to Abbott.

These tend to be the women who temporarily have given up full-time work to have children and who are seeking to re-enter the workforce by juggling childcare and effective marginal tax rates to help pay off a family mortgage and send their children to the best school they can afford.

They have high levels of debt and spending, and they tend to cluster in similarly priced housing estates in marginal seats. They were political gold when I first profiled them in the early 70s and they are still political gold in the present undernourished Labor market.

The challenge for Turnbull in selecting his new ministry is primarily to protect his base vote among Howard battlers.

He can do this by selecting an industrial relations minister who can relate directly to blue-collar working men, and a welfare minister who doesn’t poke sticks at the huge numbers of welfare recipients clustered in outer urban and provincial seats, as these voters don’t consider living in relative poverty as an entitlement.

To regain a degree of parity among middle-class and professional women, Turnbull clearly needs to select more of them as members of his cabinet — including women who understand what it’s like to hand over a crying toddler at the childcare centre or comb the headlice out of their four-year-old after kindy, all to pay off the mortgage, save for school fees and help provide a better life for their families.

If he can do that, balance the budget and generate 220,000 jobs a year, winning the next election against whoever is leading the ALP at the time should be a cinch.

I wish him well. However you vote at present, given the state of our economy and our labour ­market, we all need Turnbull to succeed.

Economists are split over whether the US central bank, at the end of a two-day meeting Thursday, will raise rates for the first time since 2006. 
 
Financial markets are pricing the likelihood of a hike at around 32 percent, Bloomberg News said, a sharp drop from before Beijing devalued the yuan in August when the majority of dealers expected a September move. 
 
While the Fed has signalled it will raise rates this year, the odds on a rise this month have dropped as concerns have mounted about slowing growth in China and its impact on the world economy. 
 
Takuji Okubo, chief economist of Japan Macro Advisors, told AFP that if the market reaction to a rate hike is limited that would suggest the global economy is in better shape than expected. 
 
“It’s not that a Fed hike itself is actually positive, but it (would mean) that the global economy isn’t as vulnerable as people feared,” Okubo said. 
 
“That could actually reduce uncertainty in the global economy. And the BoJ may like it because the yen may decline without their intervention (such as further stimulus),” he added. 
 
Asia-Pacific currencies, including the Singapore dollar and the Malaysian ringgit, which have been battered by concerns over China and the strengthening of the dollar in recent months, also rose on Wednesday.

Pluto in Capricorn - Out of Retrograde

What part of your life has been difficult, challenging and for some even downright frightening over the last five months?Early Friday morning, Pluto in Capricorn, the planet of transformation, that represents our shadow-self, is finally coming to a halt today, after being in Retrograde for 5 long months, (April 16th - Sept.25th) Pluto will be in this place through October 8th, and then will be back to its normal pace.

This has been a hard one for many of us. While Pluto was in Retrograde it helped us connect to ourselves in a deep dark way. It put us through harsh lessons and forced us to deal with issues around what empowers or disempowers us from the inside out. We have been shown and made to deal with issues around our own personal power in some very important areas of our lives, such as with money, our health, jobs and relationships!

Hopefully, we have learned down this darker path more about our shadow-self and what we are truly deeply passionate about and obsessed over. This Pluto Retrograde phase forced us to look at our behaviors and patterns, through some hard lesson and learn what we do that hurts us and take our power away!

Ask yourself what you are allowing to steal your joy? What are you doing or not doing to take care of yourself, in one way or another? This is all about what part of our lives have been the most challenging over the last 5 months, and what's situations made us feel like we had no control or power in. We've also probably either experienced what makes us feel powerful and back in control, or at the very least have an idea of what will help us to change. Over these last 5 months we've had to learn how to be honest with who we are and embrace all of who we are, the good, bad and ugly!

Now is the time to prove what we can do, and let go of any habits, behaviors, or fears that have held us back from fully being living our true potential. Whatever you've been through or learned during this Pluto Retrograde phase about your passion, inner strength or souls path...is now ready to be realized out in the world. The deep connection we made with ourselves over these last 5 months has been a learning experience, to help you be more authentic with yourself. Get back out there and work on your long-term goals, that align more so with what you truly want!

Pluto will continue to move slowly as it gets back to its normal pace through Oct. 8th. We may have to deal with some uncomfortable feelings while waiting for this energy to pick up speed again.

"Many organizations are seeking to expand their operations overseas as part of their growth strategies. In Bahrain, as well as around the world, globalization has entered a new phase, posing greater challenges for anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) compliance than ever before. Two factors are creating new issues for companies, according to a recent report by KPMG International.

First, a growing number of governments around the world are tightening ABC regulations or introducing new ones as we see in Bahrain. In the light of Kingdom’s expanding corporate culture, the government has introduced Law Number 01/2013 to expand the Amiri Decree Number 15/1976, in order to address bribery and corruption across both the public and private sectors. Second, as companies globalize their operations, they rely more heavily on third parties than before to do business in far-flung parts of the world, often in areas where there is a high risk of corruption. said: “the government has worked hard to enforce strict laws on bribery and corruption. However, as the global report highlights, with GCC based organizations and businesses increasingly investing overseas, reliance on and managing risk with third parties can be a challenge and adequate controls and monitoring must be put in place.” 

The survey, conducted by KPMG International with respondents from around the world, shows that companies are rising to the challenge but that a great deal more needs to be done to create a sturdy ABC compliance structure. For full details, read the report . The main findings of the survey include:

“Despite greater efforts to build ABC frameworks, it’s clear that there are gaping holes in them,” says Petrus Marais, Global Leader of Forensic Services for KPMG. “The problem is particularly acute in the management of third parties who increasingly act as conduits for bribes, making it harder to track. Respondents to the survey admit it’s the biggest challenge in the field of ABC, but they are not doing enough to develop a culture of compliance both among their employees and their vendors and other business associates.” 

About the survey

The survey targeted 659 respondents covering 64 countries, with 140 respondents based in Central & Eastern Europe (including Russia), 113 in Western European countries (excluding the UK), 105 from the Asia – Pacific region, 66 respondents in the U.S., 64 from the South American continent (31 in Mexico), 61 in South Africa and 41 in the UK.

The country radio DJ pauses before biting the bullet: “Has anyone been like ‘What the hell are you doing?'” she asks. 

“Every single day,” Thomas Rhett says without missing a beat. 

A half hour earlier, a dozen industry types, seated before a massive control board and a big cake sheet lined with strawberries, bopped their heads to Rhett’s “progressive” country record — one marketed to lead a sonic shift in a genre of which they are still the gatekeepers. 

“Oooh, you look so dang hot in my T-shirt” thumps one track — titled T-shirt, appropriately enough — that likens the girl in the song to a model in a Guns ‘N Roses video. “Pour a little liquor in my coconut water” repeats the infectious hook of Vacation. There’s a rap interlude from Lunch Money Lewis; a sexy duet with pop star Jordin Sparks. 

The artist blaring from the speakers sat just outside the listening session — too nervous, he said, to watch people take in tracks from his sophomore album ‘Tangled Up.’ He strides in when it’s over, bedroom eyes scanning the room for a reaction. 

“It’s fun,” the group initially declares before the question on everyone’s mind gets asked. 

The son of 90’s country singer and Nashville songwriter Rhett Akins, Rhett made his debut in 2013 with ‘bro’ songs like ‘Get Me Some of That’ and ‘It Goes Like This’ — his star seemingly reliant on the dirt road theme of the day. But in the past year, Rhett’s undergone a metamorphosis: first with his BeeGees-inspired ‘Make Me Wanna’ and then with ‘Crash & Burn,’ the Sam Cooke-style debut single off a forthcoming record that marries soul, pop, disco, electronic dance music (EDM) and a dash of rap with what’s typically known as country. 

The single Rhett was terrified to release has since become his fastest rising, biggest selling song. And nestled in the Country Billboard Top 10 this summer betwixt hits like Sam Hunt’s party-hearty ‘House Party’ and ‘Like a Wrecking Ball,’ the soulful sex-jam from Erich Church, his risk at least feels of the moment. There is comfort in acknowledging the chart-busting success of genre-blurring acts like Florida Georgia Line (who Rhett has supported on tour), Luke Bryan and Hunt, whose nearly pure-pop and R&B debut album has made him something of a (controversial) pioneer. 

“It’s very liberating” Rhett said in an interview, reflecting on his move away from “bro” and towards something entirely new. “Someone the other day was like ‘Man, I don’t know if you know this, but I feel like you’re on the brink of leading a new direction of music. 

’” 

But in the minds of traditionalists, a new direction isn’t something to which a country musician should aspire. To guys like Kyle Coroneos, who runs the website SavingCountryMusic.com, country is a genre not to be tampered with. Country music is about preserving tradition. It always has been and always will be. 

He calls this disco/EDM iteration a “bro-hangover.” The idea that bringing other genre-influences into country right now is risky, or pushing the envelope, or taking the genre somewhere new and exciting is disingenuous, he says. Instead, it contributes to one giant “mono-genre,” which he believes the merging of hip-hop and country has become. 

“The risk for country music is when you start going this far out of your boundaries, you begin to lose control of the music, you begin to lose control of your identity,” he said. “Country music is unique because it has so much of its own infrastructure and traditions — no other genre of music has four major awards shows every year, not even rock or EDM or rap. 

” 

The genre-blending and trend-chasing is exactly the fate that befell rock radio, he said. “In the 1990s and early 2000s, rock became the catch-all phrase,” he said. “What happened was it lost its identity and it sort of imploded. I think it could happen” with country music. 

Rhett doesn’t believe his music is going to cause the downfall of country music. “We’re one of those genres that sort of lives in this bubble that everyone is a little bit scared to poke that bubble, because we’re worried about what will happen when that bubble breaks,” said Rhett. “To me, I want to be that artist that when my buddies are watching me side-stage, they’ll say ‘Dang, I can’t believe they just did that in their concert.’ Or they hear a song on the record and go ‘How in the world did they cut that song and get away with it?’ There’s something kind of rebelliously fun about it. 

” 

He cites mainstream country rebel Church as inspiration, his latest rock-influenced record ‘The Outsiders’ is stacked with successful radio hits, despite its many middle-finger-to-the-man moments. But in the minds of critics, that rebelliousness is a far cry from the stuff of Willie & Waylon and more indicative of Nashville chasing the next biggest money-making thing. 

Despite all of the pop experimentation, the country music genre lives in two stubborn solitudes: There’s ‘real’ country and there’s that crap you hear on the radio. But if you’re going to refer to something as ‘real’ country, you have to have a definition of what ‘real’ country is. 

If Thomas Rhett wants to put out an album in the style of Bruno Mars and have EDM and R&B stuff … I am 100% for it. You go, Thomas Rhett. You do that. But don’t do it and sell it to country fans 

Country music’s identity is very much rooted in geography — there’s Texas Swing out of the Lone Star State; there’s Kentucky bluegrass, there’s The Bakersfield Sound in California, which was a grittier, more direct response to the slick sounds coming out of Countrypolitan Nashville. 

Perhaps the current outcry of traditionalists is a little reminiscent of the origins of rock ‘n’ roll — the combination of blues, country and gospel broke all the rules in the 1950s and pushed so many gatekeeper buttons. While Rhett’s hip gyrations are the closest he’ll ever get to Elvis, maybe his Bruno Mars covers are indeed pushing the boundaries in a good way — reminding the country music world that nothing ever new or interesting has come from colouring inside the lines. 

And if there would be no rock ‘n roll without blues, country and gospel, there would be no co…","Thomas Rhett pulls a Swift: Is country music still country music when rap, soul and EDM are included?"

* President says limit to Germany's ability to take refugees 
 
* Government defends handling of record influx 
 
* 14 injured after refugees fight at reception center

 (Adds German government reaction) 
 
By Keith Weir 
   
BERLIN, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Germany's president has warned
that there are limits to how many refugees his country can
absorb as it prepares for as many as 800,000 arrivals this year,
showing growing concern even at the highest level over how to
look after so many newcomers. 
 
""We want to help. We have a big heart. However, there is a
limit to what we can do,"" President Joachim Gauck, a former
rights activist in communist East Germany, said in a speech on
Sunday evening. 
 
""Our ability to take in people is limited, although we don't
know yet where those limits are,"" he added. 
 
The comments from the head of state, who has a largely
ceremonial role but whose words carry moral authority, appeared
to be striking a more cautious tone than Chancellor Angela
Merkel who has said Germany can cope with the record influx. 
 
The government declined to respond directly to Gauck's
comments, reflecting political convention, but defended its
handling of the situation. 
 
""The German government and the chancellor are convinced that
protection has to be given to those who need it, whether they
are persecuted for political reasons or fleeing war,"" said
government spokesman Steffen Seibert. 
 
The debate came amid signs of growing tension among asylum
seekers, part of a wave of mass migration into the European
Union from the Middle East and parts of Africa. 
 
Fourteen people were injured on Sunday when a brawl broke
out between two rival groups in a refugee center in the western
German town of Calden, police said. The refugees were being
housed in tents set up on a disused airfield. 
 
A union representing German police officers has suggested
that refugees should be divided according to their religion to
try to reduce the risk of conflict. 
 
Germany has reintroduced border controls with EU neighbors
to try to regulate the flow of people after initially throwing
open its doors to refugees from Syria. 
 
The central government also agreed last week to give its 16
regional states around 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) next year
to help cover the cost of looking after refugees. 
 
""The German government stands by its decision to now
introduce signs of order into the process for the arrival and
the admission of refugees,"" Seibert added. 
 
Merkel's popularity has dropped sharply over her handling of
the refugee crisis, two polls showed at the weekend, indicating
a shift in the mood in the Europe Union's most populous country.

"The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said it was a matter of public safety when deputies opened fire from a helicopter on a wrong-way chase suspect on the 215 Freeway. 
On Friday, a suspect led authorities on a dangerous high-speed chase through surface streets in Fontana and San Bernardino before he drove the wrong way in the northbound lanes of the freeway. He reached speeds as high as 100 mph and deputies deemed him a threat to public safety. 

Lt. Mitch Datillo said there is a lot for deputies to take into account before firing from a helicopter. 

""If you're near schools, if you're in residential areas. We have had times where we fully intended that it was getting to that level and we could not deploy, based on the backdrop and the public safety there,"" he said. 

But when the suspect jumped out of his SUV after being shot, the car continued to move and slammed head-on into another SUV, injuring three people. A relative of that family told Eyewitness News that he questions the decision by deputies to open fire from the air. 

While shooting from a helicopter is rare, it does happen. In 2004, a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff's Department opened fire from their helicopter on a suspect who was firing at deputies at a recycling plant near Irvine. 

Eyewitness News spoke with use-of-force expert and Inyo County Sheriff's Deputy Ed. Obayashi, who said he agrees with the decision to shoot, based partly on the fact of the suspect's speed while heading in the wrong direction on the freeway. 

""It could have been worse,"" he said. ""That constitutes an immediate grave danger to the public and that justifies deadly force."" 

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Special Enforcement Bureau is authorized and trains deputies to shoot from a helicopter. Ventura County sheriff's deputies are not trained, but after hearing about the deadly chase, officials said they may consider changing the policy and training deputies.",Sheriff's department says San...
"Joseph Tsang, 31, fled UK partway through rape and sex assault trial Claims he dressed as a woman and used sister's passport at Heathrow Schoolfriend who met him in Hong Kong decided to call Mail on Sunday Newspaper helped set up sting which saw Tsang arrested and in court        
Sting: Tsang is pictured above on a Hong Kong street, before he was ensnared in a sting facilitated by the Mail on Sunday 

A paedophile rapist who fled Britain on the eve of his trial for horrific sex attacks on underage girls has been arrested in Hong Kong in a dramatic ‘honey trap’ sting set up by The Mail on Sunday. 

Armed Interpol officers swooped on Joseph Tsang, who has been on the run since mid-August, after he was lured out of hiding with the promise of a date with a teenage girl on Friday night. 

This newspaper can also exclusively reveal that the 31-year-old claims he skipped Britain by disguising himself as a woman and using his sister’s passport, raising alarming questions about security at Heathrow Airport. 

He told school friend Alex O’Neill – who lives in Hong Kong – he was ‘terrified’ as he boarded a Hong Kong-bound flight and spent the flight with a hat over his face. 

Tsang started exchanging Facebook messages with O’Neill and his girlfriend, Stephanie Velenzuela, soon after his escape. 

They visited him in his hideaway in a high-rise apartment block before deciding to contact The Mail on Sunday for help to turn him in. 

We put O’Neill in touch with police in the UK and Hong Kong, but there was a tense week-long wait before an extradition order could be processed to enable Tsang’s arrest. 

Finally, hours after the extradition order was approved in Hong Kong, Tsang was lured out of his hideaway after Stephanie, 22, texted him promising to bring a teenage friend to meet him at a local McDonald’s. 
 
As he stepped out of a lift with O’Neill, the armed team pounced, pinning him to the floor and handcuffing him when he tried to swing a punch at one officer to escape. 

Yesterday, Tsang was in a detention centre awaiting extradition to Britain, where he has been convicted of raping girls aged 14 and 15 and making indecent images of a child. 
   
Led away: Tsang wore a black hood as international police escorted him to a holding cell from which UK authorities will order his extradition 

The IT professional – an accomplished ice skater who in 2009 appeared alongside Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean on ITV’s Dancing On Ice – fled Britain last month just days before his second sex offences trial. 

He was convicted in his absence of two counts of rape and two counts of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl whom he groomed on Facebook before driving her to a hotel in Portsmouth in December 2011. 

In an earlier trial in January, Tsang was convicted of one count of making indecent images of children, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and three counts of sexual activity with a child. 

Oxford Crown Court heard he lured a 14-year-old girl to his home in Oxford in 2012 to sexually abuse and take photos of her. 
  
Escape: Tsang, left, claims he escaped the UK by using a passport belonging to his sister Josephine, right, and disguising himself as a woman 

Tsang absconded after he was released on bail with the condition he wear an electronic ankle tag and surrender his UK passport. 

When he fled, Tsang – who has dual nationality – entered Hong Kong using his electronic ID card. He initially planned to ask to serve his jail term in Hong Kong. ‘He was desperate not to serve a jail term in the UK because he said he would be singled out and beaten up as a sex offender there,’ O’Neill said. 

However, when a lawyer in Hong Kong told him he must serve his term in the UK, Tsang considered fleeing to the nearby Chinese gambling resort of Macau, which has no UK extradition treaty, or slipping into Thailand on a false passport. 

He eventually decided to stay in hiding in Hong Kong and around ten days ago moved into an unfurnished 28th floor flat in the city’s Ap Lei Chau district. 
   
Skater: Tsang is circled above in Dancing On Ice, which he appeared on in 2009 alongside Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean 

O’Neill – who makes a living selling electronic goods on eBay – said: ‘Joey was a nice guy but when I saw him this time, he wasn’t the guy I used to know. He seemed to have gone a bit crazy. When he spoke about the UK cases, he said he did have sex with the girls but insisted it wasn’t rape.’ 

Stephanie said: ‘When we went to see him, he was always asking me for girls and looking at the girls on my Facebook page and saying, “Set me up with her”. He was creepy.’ 

O’Neill stayed in daily contact with police in the UK and Hong Kong as he continued visiting Tsang while an extradition order was drawn up. 

Tsang, meanwhile, grew increasingly paranoid, using binoculars to watch for police cars and monitoring the internet for news of the manhunt for him. Yesterday, Tsang appeared in a Hong Kong court where he was remanded in custody. A lawyer representing him said he would contest extradition. 

Tory MP Nicola Blackwood, for Oxford West and Abingdon, said last night: ‘Tsang inflicted a living nightmare on his victims but ran like a coward when he faced justice. I want to thank The Mail on Sunday for their help. It is going to make a big difference to the victims.’ 

A Home Office spokesman said Tsang’s sister’s passport was clean and therefore did not arouse suspicion at Heathrow because he was not on a flight risk database. 

She added: ‘Ultimately it is an airline’s responsibility to check a passport matches the person travelling.’ 

A spokesman for Heathrow Airport said: ‘We do not comment on security matters.’",Dancing On Ice skater rapist Joseph Tsang captured in Hong Kong honey trap

The Chief of Staff to President Mohammadu Buhari Lawal Kyari and the Special Adviser to the President on National Assembly matters Ita Enang yesterday evening submitted the first batch of President Mohammadu Buhari’s ministerial nominees to the Senate President Bukola Saraki

 

In a twitter message by the Senate President he acknowledged the receipt of the list as at exactly 520pm yesterday even though no further details was made by him on those in the list

 

“I can confirm that I just received the list of ministerial nominees from President Mohammadu Buhari” Saraki’s twitter handle said

 

He had earlier twitted by 400pm during the waiting game for the ministerial nominees that he had yet to receive the list as at that time

 

However earlier during the plenary the Peoples Democratic Party PDP senators had lamented that the President was keeping the nation in endless wait

 

President Buhari had during his visit to United States of America in July told journalists that he will name his cabinet members in September a promise he further repeated in Ghana early last month that Nigerians will know his ministers by the end of September

 

But when the list was not received as at yesterday plenary session of the Senate the Peoples Democratic Party PDP senators through the Minority LeaderGodswill Akpabio  Akwa Ibom North West sought clarification

 

Akpabio who came through a point of order under matter of urgent importance asked the Senate President  Bukola Saraki on why he did not announce any communication from the President on ministerial nominees as widely expected and in line with the President’s promise

 

He noted that the nation’s newspapers in the last couple of weeks have been awash with stories of ministerial appointments by the president and further asked the Senate President why he received the list from President Buhari and was hiding it from his colleagues

 

As Saraki attempted to answer Akpabio’s question Deputy Senate LeaderIbn Bala Na’AllahAPCKebbi South raised another point of order upon which he explained that the day was still young saying since the day’s session ends by 1230pm there was still the hope that the president would transmit the list of ministerial nominees to the Upper Chamber before the close of the session

 

He also said since the day ends by 1159pm there was still hope that the list could come before the time

 

The Senate President however ruled Akpabio out of order 

 

Making further clarifications later on the much expected list to journalists the Chairman Senate’ Ad Hoc Committee on Media and Publicity Dino Melaye  APC Kogi West said the news making the rounds that the list has been received by the Senate President was untrue

 

“As far as the Senate is concerned the much expected ministerial list  has not been received ”  he said

 

He however added that the list will definitely be received by the Senate President  Bukola Saraki before the next Senate ‘s plenary session next week Tuesday and will be thoroughly and expeditiously considered

 

“We want to announce that we are still waiting for the ministerial list from Mr president and I want to advise that their is no need for agitation as September expires by 12 mid night today

 

“We want to assure Nigeria that as soon as we get possession of this list we will communicate same to Nigerians through the National assembly press Corp

 

“Once again we want to reassure Nigeria again that we will attend to the ministerial nominees expeditiously but diligently

“Due process will be followed and I repeat that it is not going to be business as usual we are going to properly screen all nominees and only those who meet the constitutional and moral requirements shall be cleared” he said",Saraki confirms receipt of ministerial nominees to Senate
"VETERANS saluted Worcester's first ever breakfast club for ex-soldiers which won over hearts, minds and bellies. 
 
The Worcester Breakfast Club for HM Forces Veterans met at the Postal Order in Foregate Street at 10am on Saturday. 
 
The club is designed to allow veterans a place to meet, socialise, eat and drink, giving hunger and loneliness their marching orders. 
 
Father-of-two Dave Carney, aged 43, of Merrimans Hill, Worcester, set up the club after being inspired by other similar clubs across the country. 
 
He said: ""As you can see from the picture, we had a good response. Five out of the 10 that attended said they saw the article in the newspaper and turned up. 
 
""We even had an old chap travel from Droitwich and he was late on parade by three hours. 
 
""It's generated a lot of interest and I estimate (from other veterans who saw the article) that next month's meeting will attract about 20 people. Onwards and upwards."" 
 
He said the management at the pub had been extremely hospitable to them. 
 
Mr Carney said: ""They bent over backwards for us. They really looked after us well. That is the best choice of venue I could have made. They even put 'reserved for the armed forces'. 
   Promoted stories   
The reserve veteran with the Royal Engineers wanted to go to a breakfast club but found the nearest ones were in Bromsgrove and Gloucester so he decided to set up his own, closer to home. 
 
He was influenced by Derek Hardman who set up a breakfast club for veterans in Hull and Andy Wilson who set one up in Newcastle. He said the idea has snowballed and there were now 70 similar clubs across the country and even some in Germany. 
 
Mr Carney said with many Royal British Legion clubs closing he wanted veterans and serving personnel to feel they had somewhere they could go for good grub, beer and banter to recapture the comradery of being in the forces. 
 
The Postal Order was chosen because of its central location and its proximity to the railway station and hotels and reasonably priced food and drink. 
 
The management of the pub have even given the veterans a designated area within the pub.

(InGoal photo by Scott Slingsby) Washington Capitals’ netminder Justin Peters went under the knife on Monday, a procedure the club called “successful.” In a brief news release Washington said Peters underwent surgery on his left knee and they expected the 28-year old to be ready for training camp, though an official start date has not been announced. The Capitals first preseason game is against Florida on September 21st. Peters’ agent Jordan Neumann told the Washington Post Peters had been rehabilitating a sore knee that did not improve as expected, so they opted for surgery. “I would expect he’s doing everything in full gear, taking shots prior to the start of training camp,” Neumann said. “We expect him to be a full participant on day one of camp.” Peters played just 12 games for Washington last season – his first with the club after joining from Carolina – going 3-6-1 with a .881 save percentage and 3.25 goals against average. The Blyth, Ontario native is entering the final season of a two-year, one-way contract worth $950,000, and will be an unrestricted free agent next summer. he is expected to compete with German prospect Phillip Grubauer for the backup role behind recently re-signed No.1 Braden Holtby. Grubauer was selected ahead of Peters during the Eastern Conference quarter finals, when starter Braden Holtby was sidelined due to illness ahead of Game 2, and the 23-year old is considered a bright goaltending prospect. Grubauer’s emergence and new one-way contract suggest Peters may be AHL bound this season, but a return in time for training camp will at least allow him to compete for the backup role after a disappointing first year with the club.

"In April 1987, when China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping met the Basic Law Drafting Committee members in Beijing, he criticised the suggestion to introduce the principle of separation of powers to the would-be Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. He said Hong Kong could not copy directly from the West. 
 
The then undemocratic system in Hong Kong was based on the British system, and had been in practice for a century and a half. Deng said it would not be appropriate to introduce to such a system the separation of powers or a British or American parliamentary system, just so it could be seen as a democracy. 
 
After Deng's comments, the drafting committee ceased using the term ""separation of powers"". 
 
It thus came as no surprise that in Zhang Xiaoming's recent speech on "" A Correct Understanding of the Characteristics of the Political System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region "", the director of the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong ruled out the existence of separation of powers in Hong Kong and said that separation of powers can be built only on the basis of a political entity in possession of complete state sovereign power. 
 
While Zhang may be correct from a strictly legal point of view, in reality, the political system in Hong Kong has evolved since the colonial era to put in place by convention - in practice and in spirit - the principle of separation of powers. The three branches of government each have their own role and function, creating checks and balances between the executive and the legislature, while upholding judicial independence. Whatever term one may use to describe it, it is separation of powers in a real sense. 
 
Zhang described the chief executive as having a ""dual head"" status, that is, he is head of the Hong Kong government and at the same time head of the SAR. Zhang also said that the chief executive has ""dual accountability"", that is, he or she is accountable to the central government and also to the Hong Kong government. 
 
Both these ""dual"" characteristics, according to Zhang, mean that the chief executive has a special legal status that transcends the executive, the legislature and the judiciary.

In an article published in October 2013, Hao Tiechuan, director of publicity, cultural and public affairs of the central government's liaison office here, recounted that in July 1987, while drafting of the Basic Law was in progress, the British sent to the Chinese a summary on the transition issues relating to the executive and the legislature. Hao said the British team agreed that the Hong Kong government should be led by a strong executive, but there should be appropriate checks and balances between the executive and the legislature, and the two sides should maintain a cooperative relationship. 
 
Hao also said that the British stated that the power to accept or reject laws passed by the Legislative Council and the power to dissolve Legco is important to the status of the chief executive under the constitution. 
 
During the colonial era, the governor, as the representative of the British monarch, held the power to approve or reject laws passed by legislature and the power to dissolve it, and thus had a status that truly transcended the executive and the legislature. By comparison, the chief executive has a much less ""transcendent"" status than the colonial governor. 
 
Whether the chief executive 'transcends' all else or not, Zhang's remarks alone do not mean the chief executive's position has been lifted to that of an emperor 
 
First, by the Hong Kong Letters Patent and the Royal Instructions, the governor was the representative of the British monarch, accountable only to the king or queen. Under Article 43 of the Basic Law, the chief executive is accountable to both the central government and the SAR government. 
 
Second, the governor was free to reject laws passed by Legco and was free to dissolve the legislature. Under Article 50 of the Basic Law, the chief executive has only very limited power in this regard. 
 
Third, there was no mechanism for the impeachment of the governor. Yet, the SAR legislature can initiate proceedings to impeach the chief executive in accordance with Article 73 of the Basic Law. 
 
Fourth, during the colonial era, the council did not have the power to force the governor to resign. Under Article 52 of Basic Law, the chief executive must resign under certain specified circumstances.

The chief executive's inherited status and power of the governor have been curtailed by the Basic Law. Whether the chief executive ""transcends"" all else or not, Zhang's remarks alone do not mean the chief executive's position has been lifted to that of an emperor, as suggested by Civic Party legislator Alan Leong Kah-kit. 
 
Not only does he not have an imperial sword, as former education chief Michael Suen Ming-yeung stated, but, rather, recent events - including the High Court ruling against the Chief Executive in Council's decision to refuse to issue a TV licence - clearly show that the SAR's vibrant and independent judiciary is the sword of Damocles hanging over the head of the ""transcendent"" chief executive.

Major U.S. indices relinquished stronger gains of over 1 percent but stayed in positive territory, with ongoing worries about China's economy on the minds of investors.

""Whether it's in the U.S., Japan or Europe, the market likes quantitative easing,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. ""But China concerns have not gone away."" 

""I’m expecting choppiness for a while longer.""

Draghi's remarks came a day ahead of the monthly U.S. nonfarm payrolls data, which is expected to show that the economy added 220,000 nonfarm jobs in August, up from 215,000 in July.

The combination of a healing U.S. labour market and worries about a stumbling Chinese economy are challenging the Fed as it heads into a meeting on Sept 16-17 where it may raise interest rates for the first time since 2006.

Near-zero rates have allowed the U.S. stock market to stage a spectacular bull-run since the financial crisis. But the market was rocked by volatility in the past two weeks, triggered by fears of slowing growth in China.

Some investors believe the market turmoil, which left the S&P 500 with its biggest monthly drop in three years in August, may lead the Fed to delay a rate hike until the end of the year.

The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", fell 1.65 percent to 25.64 on Thursday, slightly above the long-term average of 20. The index had spiked as much as 53.29 early last week.

At 2:53 pm, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 0.37 percent to 16,412.58 and the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.41 percent to 1,956.93. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.09 percent to 4,754.28.

Nine of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher, with the telecommunications index's .SPLRCL 1.0 percent rise leading the advancers.

Apple was the biggest drag on S&P 500 with a 1.36 percent drop while Intel's 2.15 percent gain helped push the index higher.

Joy Global's shares were down 16 percent after the mining equipment maker reported a fall in quarterly profit and cut its full-year forecast.

Caterpillar also fell 2.6 percent and was the biggest drag on the Dow.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,961 to 1,012. On the Nasdaq, 1,530 issues rose and 1,236 fell.

The S&P 500 index showed no new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 28 new highs and 32 new lows.

"We've got tips, tours and deals. 

The dollar may be down, but that doesn't mean packing away the passport permanently. In fact, New research, Expedia Value Tracker, reveals the best value spots for a Christmas trip overseas, and even the US figures as a possibility. That's because currency fluctuations are not the only monetary movement to factor in. Changes in accommodation, flight and living costs all contribute to the value of a holiday.

For instance, New Zealand is the only destination where the Australian dollar currently goes further than it did a year ago, up four per cent year-on-year. But the average accommodation cost there has risen nine per cent, while average flight prices between NZ and Australia have decreased five per cent. That all adds up to Expedia considering New Zealand the best value option for Aussies right now.

As for the US, the fact that flight costs have dipped 10 per cent in the past year offsets the dollar drop of 21 per cent and counting – a little. Expedia says travellers might find better value across the border in Canada this year, where the Australian dollar has only fallen six per cent against the Canadian dollar and flights decreased by six per cent year-on-year. That's especially relevant for those considering a Christmas ski break.

Expedia Australia and NZ managing director MD George Ruebensal suggests, however, you think creatively. ""If travellers are flexible about where they go, there are opportunities to save. And when thinking about Europe, that's exciting as there are so many amazing places to explore. For instance, why not consider Norway where the Aussie dollar has gained ground against the Norwegian krone and average hotel and flight prices have also decreased.""

The Aussie has also gained more than 30 per cent against the Russian ruble.

"A BIG criticism of Mark Cooper’s play-off final-losing side last season was they only had one way to win a game. 
 
The manager often explained this was because of the players he had and using a system that best suited their abilities. 
 
To some extent this season, he has either demonstrated a willingness to work with multiple systems or he feels he has more tactically astute players. Given the relative experience of the players he has now and the ones departed, you would surmise it is probably the latter. 
 
Cooper admitted on Saturday that a difference in formation is often as little as a five-yard tweak, but in the context of the win at Crewe, it was important. 
 
In the first half, Town started with a 4-2-3-1. James Brophy, making his second senior start, was pushed forward into the advanced left-wing position and Nicky Ajose was given the task on the right. 
 
It was not very successful. Brophy struggled to get forward as he too often had to help out Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill, who was having a poor game against Ryan Colclough. Eventually, Brophy was moved into defence. 
 
With just two central midfielders to link play between attack and defence, Swindon actually struggled to dominate the ball. 
 
At half-time, the Town boss accepted he would not be able to control the midfield with the players he had available and instead opted to utilise his forwards' ability on the break. 
 
Ormonde-Ottewill’s injury was a blessing in disguise. Brophy dealt much better with Colclough and Cooper used the opportunity to switch to a 4-4-2 diamond, with youngster Tom Smith coming on to provide more energy in midfield. 
   
 Share article  
   
Though Town ceded control of midfield and spent more time defending, they looked a more potent attacking force with Nicky Ajose and Wes Thomas paired together up front. 
 
Chances came when they stretched Crewe’s defence with balls in behind, but it was also the ability of the two strikers to harry their opponents and win the ball high up the pitch that created chances.",TALKING TACTICS: finding the right Plan B

"Official says 'small number' of Benghazi-related emails

An email chain between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and then-commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus from January and February 2009 is raising questions about whether some of the emails on Clinton's private email server were mistakenly deemed personal and not included among the 55,000 pages of emails she turned over to the State Department. 

Separately on Friday, a State Department official said a ""small number"" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the House committee investigating the 2012 terror attack had been discovered. 

In the past few days, the State Department was contacted by the Department of Defense about the Clinton-Petraeus chain, two State Department officials said. The officials say the chain does not appear to include classified information, though an official determination has not been made. The chain included Clinton and Petraeus getting acquainted as well as some personnel matters, according to the officials. It was apparently considered personal by Clinton's team and therefore wasn't turned over to the State Department, the officials said. 

Most of the email chain was on an old email server Clinton says she no longer has access to, but the end of the email chain contained messages on the private server she used while in office, according to another official. The chain begins on January 10, 2009 and ends on Feb. 1, 2009 and contains less than 10 emails total between Clinton and Petraeus, the official said. 

State Department spokesman John Kirby said State received ""several copies of one email chain between former Secretary Clinton and then Commander of U.S. Central Command David Petraeus which were not previously in the possession of the Department"" from the Department of Defense and the State Inspector General. ""These emails are now in our possession and will be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests. Furthermore, we asked the IG to incorporate this matter into the review Secretary Kerry requested in March. We have also informed Congress of this matter."" 

Also on Friday, a State Department official also told CNN that in the process of turning over Libya-related emails to the Select Committee on Benghazi, it found a ""small number"" of Benghazi-related emails that had not been disclosed to the committee previously. These emails are among 925 Libya-related emails being turned over Friday and were found within the emails Clinton turned over to the State Department from her private server. The official said the emails were found because they have now been digitized and are easier to search. 

Clinton turned over to State her work-related emails from the server and kept emails she deemed personal. The email server has since been turned over to the FBI, where investigators have been able to recover both the personal and work-related emails. The FBI is looking into whether any classified materials were mishandled.",New Hillary Clinton email chain discovered

"Auckland News.Net  Thursday 17th September, 2015  
 U.S. Ambassador to India, Richard Verma, has said that the developments of the past year show that India is determined to emerge from its slumber as the second sleeping giant of Asia and reclaim its historical position as one of the great world powers. 
""Indian leaders have expressed a determination to leave behind the traditions of non-alignment and strategic autonomy and, in the words of Foreign Secretary Jaishankar, to become a 'leading power',"" he added. 
 
Verma said the strategic partnership between India and the US will be unlike the geo-political alliances of the 20th century. 
 
""Rather than remaining confined to one corner of our planet, we will work to uphold the global systems and spaces that will allow for the continued advancement of humankind. In the words of Prime Minister Modi the great promise of the U.S.-India relationship is what both countries ""can do together for the world."" To be sure, the U.S.-India strategic partnership will be anchored in Asia,"" said Verma. 
 
""But it will also be a truly 21st century relationship of natural allies working together in cyberspace, global hotspots, outer space, the human genome and the global biome,"" he added. 
 
Asserting that India is seeking to make up for lost time, the US envoy said India is still grappling with a legacy of systemic economic challenges that have hampered its growth in comparison to other Asian powers in the 20th century. 
 
""However, India has exerted a profound historical impact on the global economy, and is poised to do so again. For much of recorded history, until the 18th century in fact, India's GDP matched or exceeded that of China and dwarfed production in Europe,"" said Verma. 
 
""As the birthplace of Buddhism and a historical center of Sufi Islam, India's cultural influence extends from Southeast Asia to Mongolia and from Indonesia to the steppes of Central Asia,"" he added. 
 
The US envoy said the relationship between New Delhi and Washington will serve as an important new buttress safeguarding open commerce and freedom of navigation in the Asia-Pacific region. 
 
""Through dialogues such as the U.S.-India East Asia Consultations which the East West Center graciously hosted in June and the U.S.-India -Japan Trilateral Dialogue, we are working together to promote a democratic and rules-based vision for political and economic security in Asia,"" said Verma in his remarks on ""An Alliance for Global Prosperity"" at EWC, Hawaii. 
 
""But our bilateral relationship will be much more far-reaching. The U.S. and Indian governments are engaging agricultural professionals from Kenya, Malawi and Liberia to improve food security in their countries by increasing crop yields using new technologies,"" he added. 
 
The US envoy said India's generic pharmaceutical industry and highly skilled biotechnology workforce will be essential to addressing the greatest health challenges in all countries across the economic spectrum. 
 
""Our countries are exchanging findings from current Mars missions and are sharing ideas about future explorations. Prime Minister Modi recently hosted the third USAID-supported Call to Action Summit to end preventable maternal and child deaths,"" said Verma. 
 
""The United States and India have joined forces to advance a multi-stakeholder model of internet governance and are working to bring together industry, academia and regulators in both our countries in support of this vision. These are just a few examples that show how the scope of our alliance will not limited by geography or sector but will encompass the full spectrum of human endeavor,"" he added. 
 
Verma said as the Indian governments have come and gone the ideal of a multiethnic democracy has remained at the very core of the national consciousness. 
 
""In this way India was perhaps the first truly 21st century country. In the decades after 1947, the freedom riders who were trained in Gandhi's ideals and methods, and in some cases in India by Gandhi's associates themselves, helped the United States begin to come to terms with our own history of injustice, providing the reconciliation that allowed for our post-Cold War prosperity and influence,"" he added. 
 
Verma said the commitment to a democratic system and the rule of law that have made India an island of stability in a continent that has seen tremendous upheaval in the past 50 years will continue to provide the Indian people the platform on which to construct their 21st century emergence. 
 
""That India has lifted millions out of poverty and many of its 1.2 billion people have prospered while living under a transparent system of government demonstrates that the principles both countries hold dear are not ""American"" or ""Asian"" but human aspirations,"" said Verma. 
 
""This shared view of a government that is inclusive and accountable to its people has resulted in India, despite its considerable economic challenges, leading the pack in a number of key indicators. Indian citizens are among the world's most numerous and active social media users - much has been written about the Indian impact on platforms such as Twitter and Instagram,"" he added. 
 
The US envoy said the Indian innovators are among the most successful and prolific patent applicants in the world, and Indian companies, drawing on a highly educated English speaking workforce, are deeply integrated into global business processing. 
 
""Recent controversies notwithstanding, India's civil society is composed of tens of thousands of vocal and active NGOs that are influencing policy and budgets around the country. In this century, the advancement of prosperity will require the ability to nurture innovations, energize global audiences with new ideas and build cross-cultural understanding,"" said Verma. 
 
""I need only to consider the number of Indian citizens using Facebook on cell phones charged by village entrepreneurs selling solar power to be certain that India is primed to succeed in these challenges,"" he added.

LAFIA—Nasarawa State government yesterday said it would employ about 1500 workers into its civil service before the end of 2015 in a bid to curtail the rate of unemployment being witnessed in the state

Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura stated this on the occasion of Nasarawa State Labour summit held in Lafia the state capital Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura The governor added that the state government would equally continue with its biometric analysis of workers to block all leakages to ascertain the actual number of workforce in the state’s payroll for prompt payment of salaries

He however said since his assumption of office as governor of the state in 2011 no state civil servant had failed to get his or her salary as and when due despite the implementation of the new minimum wage and the present dwindling revenue from the federation account

But he blamed the present irregularities in the payment of local government workers salaries on officials of the local councils who had over blotted their workforce

On the Federal Government bailout fund the governor said N8 billion was released to the state with both the state and local governments sharing N4 billion each

He was however quick to add that the bailout was a temporary measure and asked such beneficiaries to brace up to mitigate their revenue misfortunes

The governor cited an instance where local councils in the state would use the bailout to pay salary arrears of less than two months of its workers adding that the council areas would still go back to the same problem

According to him people should not think that the bailout will be a permanent thing

On the clamour by local council officials for a 10 percent remittance from the Internally Revenue Generation IGR to them by the state government Al-Makura categorically told the local officials to declare what their local governments generate before they could enjoy such a privilege","Nasarawa gets N8bn bailout, plans to employ 1500 workers"

"Mobile dental repair franchise kicks off national charity program to support breast cancer research

DAVIE, Fla. (PRWEB) September 22, 2015 

In observance of Breast Cancer Awareness month, Dental Fix RX, a mobile dental equipment repair company, will be collecting donations throughout the month of October to benefit breast cancer research. The fundraising program encourages franchise owner/operators across North America to give back and support charities by gathering contributions from dental customers and through personal donations. A percentage of the total earned will also be matched by Dental Fix’s corporate office in Florida. 

“Breast cancer has personally affected several of us at Dental Fix, and we’re honored to launch this program to help find a cure,” said David Lopez, CEO of Dental Fix RX. “Our participating owners will continue their work during October, but with pink shirts, branded bracelets, and promotional materials to gather donations and better inform their dental customers just how important breast cancer research is.” 

Donors will be given pink branded bracelets and printed collateral highlighting the importance of their contributions. Dental Fix owners will be able to contribute themselves by purchasing specially branded pink work shirts to wear throughout the month. A percentage of the total contributions will then be matched by Dental Fix corporate, while the highest performing owner will receive special recognition at the company’s 2016 franchise convention. 

“From our corporate offices, to our owners and customers, we are looking forward to this program making a huge impact on breast cancer awareness,” said Lopez. “Given we have more than 200 franchise owners throughout North America and serve approximately 14,000 dental customers, we stand to make a difference on this critical issue.”

An early glimpse at the income tax picture for 2016 is now available 
      from Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US. The new information includes 
      estimated ranges for each 2016 tax bracket as well as projections for a 
      growing number of inflation-sensitive tax figures, such as the personal 
      exemption and the standard deduction. Projections are based on the 
      relevant inflation data recently released by the U.S. Department of 
      Labor. 
  
 Inflation Adjustments - Background  
 
Since the late 1980s, the U.S. Tax Code has required that federal income 
      tax brackets be adjusted for inflation annually, and inflation 
      adjustments have been inserted into the Internal Revenue Code in recent 
      years with increasing frequency. For example, the Code now requires over 
      50 other inflation-driven computations to determine deduction, exemption 
      and exclusion amounts in addition to the 40 separate computations needed 
      to inflation-adjust the tax bracket tables each year. 
 
 Media Assistance  
 
Expert analysis plus additional details regarding the following 
      projections and tax topics are available for media members interested in 
      speaking with federal tax experts at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US.

 Key Tax Savings, Non-increase Estimates for 2016 : 
 
Projections based on the Department of Labor's inflation figures for the 
      12-month period between August 31, 2014, and August 31, 2015 suggest 
      most taxpayers will experience modest savings, compared to 2015 tax 
      filings. For example: 
 Because of the income ranges bracketing the marginal tax rates have 
        increased, a single filer with taxable income of $50,000 should owe 
        $22.50 less next year due to the adjustments to the income tax rate 
        brackets between 2015 and 2016.  A married couple filing jointly with a total taxable income of 
        $100,000 should pay $45 less income taxes in 2016 than they will on 
        the same income for 2015 because of indexing of their tax bracket for 
        2016.  The dependent standard deduction, used on the returns of individuals 
        claimed as dependents on another taxpayer's tax return, remains at 
        $1,050 for 2016.  The additional standard deduction for those 65-years-old and older or 
        who are blind will remain at $1,250 for 2016, as will the $1,550 
        additional amount for single aged 65 or older or blind filers.  
 Inflation-adjusted Tax Increase Estimates for 2016:  
 The personal exemption amount gets bumped up by inflation by $50, to 
        $4,050 for 2016, up from $4,000 in 2015.  The standard deduction for single, married filing jointly, and married 
        filing separately filers is expected to remain the same for 2016. The 
        standard deduction for heads of household is expected to rise from 
        $9,250 for 2015 to $9,300 for 2016. Any increase in the standard 
        deduction, of course, can produce lower taxes by decreasing the 
        taxpayer's taxable income.  Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting US projects the following for 2016 
        alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemptions: For married joint filers and surviving spouses, the exemption will 
            be adjusted upward to $83,800, up from $83,400 for 2015.  For unmarried single filers and heads of households, the 2016 
            exemption will be $53,900, up from $53,600 for 2015.  For married single filers, the exemption will increase to $41,900, 
            up from $41,700 in 2015.   The 2016 year represents the third year that the 39.6-percent tax 
        bracket for higher-income taxpayers, enacted by the American Taxpayer 
        Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), will be imposed. For 2016, Wolters Kluwer 
        projects that the minimum income amounts at which this top tax rate 
        will kick in will rise to: $466,950 (from $464,850) for married joint filers  $441,000 (from $439,000) for heads of households  $415,050 (from $413,200) for unmarried filers  $233,475 (from $232,425) for married separate filers  These inflation-adjusted amounts also trigger a 20-percent tax on 
            that portion of taxable income attributable to net capital gains 
            and qualified dividends that exceed these bracket amounts.   The estate and gift tax applicable exemption was first set at a $5 
        million level back in 2011. The amount has been adjusted for inflation 
        by Congress and is now projected at $5,450,000 for 2016. A spousal 
        portability election can now effectively protect double that amount 
        against estate and gift tax ($10,900,000 for 2016).  The 2016 foreign earned income exclusion will increase to $101,300 for 
        2016, up from $100,800 for 2015.  The income phaseout range for married joint filers making Roth IRA 
        contributions will be $184,000 to $194,000 for 2016, an increase from 
        $183,000 and $193,000 for 2015.

"Tim Ernst grew up in Williamsville playing video games like “Mega Man” and “The Legend of Zelda” on his console, and “Ultima” and “Warcraft”... Read…  
Tim Ernst grew up in Williamsville playing video games like “Mega Man” and “The Legend of Zelda” on his console, and “Ultima” and “Warcraft” on his computer. 

“I loved them. They were something I just saw so much potential in,” Ernst said. “It was always heartbreaking to play a game that was terrible. And if you played one that was amazing, it was just an unbelievable experience. 

” 

Today, he gets to play – and design, and develop – video games for a living. Ernst, 34, is general manager of Kabam Games, where he oversees about 100 employees in the company’s San Francisco development studio. 

He’s playing a leading role in the company’s latest mobile game, “Star Wars: Uprising,” which came out Thursday and is tied to the eagerly awaited next installment in the “Star Wars” movie franchise, set for release in December. 

Kabam has found a niche in making interactive, role-playing games for smartphones and tablets. The games are free to download and play but offer users the chance to pay for additional items within the game. 

It’s one segment of the massive, highly competitive video-game market, in which Ernst got his start with an internship at Ubisoft while studying at Yale University. He later worked at Sega of America and Bedlam Games before joining Kabam four years ago. 

The Canisius High School graduate spoke to The News during a recent trip to Western New York, where he visited family and tried to squeeze in stops at Duff’s Famous Wings, Gabriel’s Gate, Mighty Taco, Wegmans and other hometown favorites. 

Q: Is making video games work? 

A: Clearly we’re not just playing games. We, to a certain extent, do rocket science inside of video games. But it’s sure enjoyable – it’s an industry full of passionate people. 

Q: Kabam’s niche is in role-playing games, or RPGs, for mobile devices. What are they? 

A: A role-playing game is really a video game world. It’s got to be complete, with people you talk to, a story. But your character, your customization, your choices, as well as how you interact with both people in the game, and other people playing the game, is what makes the genre unique. 

Q: Are role-playing games a small part of the market compared to console and PC games? 

A: No, it is it not a small segment of the overall industry. In fact, multiple games last year made over $1 billion themselves. So, there has been success. And the people that have been successful have stayed at the top for a long period of time. It’s also a growth market because of international – specifically China. China’s a huge market that console games, traditional games, have not been able to break into. 

Q: How do you provide the immersed gaming experience you get from playing on a desktop or console to people playing on their phones? 

A: That’s one of the things that we’re trying to pioneer. We just released a game seven months ago called “Marvel: Contest of Champions,” which is a fighting game that had some light story elements. And really it’s about making it a game – it’s not a mobile game being an apology. So we’re trying to push more the true, classic video game experiences inside of a phone. And that does mean that if we’re making an RPG (role playing game), we have to tell our story a little differently – our pacing’s very different. 

Q: “Star Wars: Uprising” will be free to download and play. How does Kabam make money through the game? 

A: The basis of free to play is everybody can download it because we want as many people as possible to start playing it. And, really, the core of free play is being able to offer people what we call “pay against the grind.” So if you want to do something in the game, and it’s going to take you a couple of extra hours – it’s not like a timer, but let’s say I have to run 10 dungeons – there’s a route to kind of make that a lot shorter. It’s optional. 

Q: How does the game fit within the “Star Wars” storyline? 

A: “Star Wars: Uprising” is set in the Anoat Sector, which you could call the “Empire Strikes Back” sector. So it’s Hoth, Cloud City, the planets around there. And it’s right after “Return of the Jedi.” So this is time that nobody has explored in games. Basically, after the emperor, Death Star II, and the emperor is killed, the governor of the system, Governor Adelhard, basically puts an iron blockade down. Now, he’s an imperialist. He believes that what the Empire’s doing is truly great for the galaxy. And he puts a blockade that prevents trade, that prevents rebel propaganda. But ultimately you’re pushing back against Adelhard’s iron blockade. And there’s five factions. The Rebel Alliance is one of the factions. 

Q: Is it completely open-ended, or is there a way to win the game? 

A: I don’t know that there’s winning, because it’s a living world. But clearly you want to win, you want to beat the Empire. And we don’t really look at it as just a game or a packaged product. This is a service, and we want to create the Star Wars community, the place for everyone to live their “Star Wars” dream. So how you push back against the Empire is part of the game, and one of the parts that will evolve. And as the community reacts, t…",A video game fan brings ‘Star Wars’ to your smartphone

Will the VMAs drama ever end? 

Pink isn't feeling red in the face after comments she allegedly made on a private Instagram went public. The 35-year-old singer-songwriter made headlines Thursday after she reportedly weighed in on the  earlier that week, confessing to a fan she felt ""embarrassed,"" ""sad"" and ""old"" while watching this year's show. ""In all seriousness; I felt sad because music is supposed to inspire. It saved my life. This trash won't save any kids life. In a world that is even scarier and with lives still worth saving, who will stand up and have soul?"" she asked. ""Disenfranchised to say the least. Let down by my industry and peers."" 

Pink then name-dropped a few acts, writing, ""Beside Macklemore and Pharrell and [ Justin ] Bieber (pre-sob fest) and The Weeknd , Tori Kelly was dope too. The rest was gross and embarrassing and hard for this aging pop star to believe."" 

E! News reached out to Pink's rep to confirm or clarify her comments Thursday. 
 Kevin Mazur/MTV1415/WireImage   
Right or wrong, many people assumed the ""Just Give Me a Reason"" singer was slamming host Miley Cyrus , as well as performers and pop peers Iggy Azalea , Demi Lovato , Nicki Minaj and Taylor Swift , as she didn't offer them any praise. 

Publicly, Pink trashed the annual awards show, , ""I'm convinced MTV just bought up all dispensaries before airing this show."" Pink did give props to one performer, though, , ""Ok @ToriKelly - fan for life. Great freaking performance tonight, you live singing, guitar playing accapella sanging woman."" 

After her alleged Instagram comments made the rounds, Pink defended herself via  that night. ""Please look for a feud elsewhere. I have no issue with Demi Lovato or anyone else. I actually forgot she performed. I have opinions. MANY,"" she told her followers, , ""I stand by what I said. However, I didn't intend for the angry people of the world to latch on and make it into something it isn't. Peace."" 

Pink then retweeted several supportive messages: 

@Pink Pink doesn't play the trashy tabloid game and is in a league of her own so you're bitchy tweets are meaningless. You cannot touch her.

"CHICAGO – Sept. 28, 2015 – An influx of storm-chasing contractors may be indirectly pushing up home insurance prices in areas where they operate. These contractors often knock on homeowners' doors and say they need a new roof or siding due to wind and hail damage – all cosmetic damage repairs that may not be necessary. Fixing it may help a home look better, but it won't function better. 
 
Home insurance companies often classify dents, dimples and dings in roof vents, shingles or aluminum siding as ""cosmetic damage"" to a property, says Billy Van Jura, an insurance broker in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. 
 
""When several claims for this type of work are submitted in a single region, the price everyone pays (including those who haven't filed a claim) can increase because the insurer sees the region as having greater risk of additional claims,"" an article at realtor.com® cautions. ""There's nothing you can do about a widespread storm that damages several homes in your area and ultimately raises everyone's rates."" 
 
However, ""you can help curb your own annual home insurance costs with a little-known option called 'cosmetic damage exclusion."" 
 
The American Association of Insurance Services created the cosmetic damage exclusion in 2013. Its goal is to protect consumers from scammers and attempt to keep home insurance rates more affordable by making cosmetic damage coverage optional. 
 
Homeowners can then decide if they want to pay for cosmetic-only wind and hail damage. If the damage impacts the safety or structural functionality of the home, the home insurance policy kicks in. 
 
By adding this exclusion to cosmetic damage, homeowners stand to save money on their annual premiums – anywhere from $100 to $200 or more, says Troy Thompson, an independent insurance broker with Pinnacle Insurance Agency in Coon Rapids, Minn. 
 
Hail and wind damage claims alone contribute to about 40 percent of all home insurance claims in the last five years, according to the Insurance Information Institute.
